Archive submissions should be mailed to elisp-archive@cis.ohio-state.edu
if they consist of a single file.  Mailed submissions are automatically
saved and periodically archived.  The incoming directory is no longer
available for submissions at the request of Ohio State.

Messages regarding problems with the archive, such as missing files or
files that won't decompress, should also be sent to this address.

Submissions consisting of multiple files should not be mailed.  Instead
a mail message with the LCD archive entry (see the GUIDELINES file) should
be mailed to the archive address with a location from which the tarred and
compressed files can be ftped.  If you cannot provide the files through
anonymous ftp, we will arrange a drop location in private mail.

Entries in the LCD (Lisp Code Directory) for packages that are maintained
at other locations are also welcomed and encouraged.

NEWS FLASHES:
=============
Mon Jul 19 15:54 1993

A recent change in the OSU ftpd is making the default permissions of
newly archived files unreadable via anonymous ftp.  To counter this
problem we have set up a cron job that every hour on the hour to
correct any bogus permissions.  If you run across a file that you
cannot read, wait for the next cron job to run, then try again.
