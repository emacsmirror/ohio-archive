Mailcrypt version 3.3 is now available.

Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
to message encryption with PGP.  (You do use Emacs to handle your mail
and news, right?)

Features: Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting
keys, passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
(including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.

*We* think it's the best interface to these functions anywhere, but
then again, we're biased.

The NEWS file is appended to this message.

Obtain it through the Mailcrypt home page at

and enjoy!
