Below is a brief description of the files in this distribution.  See
the file example.emacs to use this code.

cl-shell.el - provides a major mode (cl-shell-mode) for running Common
  Lisp (CL) as an Emacs subprocess.  Features include direct (ie not
  through a temp file) evaluation and in-package compilation of forms
  from lisp-mode buffers, type-ahead and a history mechanism for the
  cl-shell buffer, and pop-up help facilities for the CL functions
  documentation, macroexpand and describe.  The extensions for Lucid
  Common Lisp in the file cl-lucid.el provide pop-up arglists and
  source file editing.  Other extensions are provided in cl-pcl.el and
  cl-flavors.el which allow editing source files of methods.  The code
  in cl-shell.el, however, is stand-alone and does not require any of
  these.  Provides a general mechanism for communication between CL and
  Emacs which does not rely on extra processes.
     A more detailed description may be found in the file
  cl-shell.doc and at the top of the file cl-shell.el.  To use the
  code, you should either copy cl-shell, shell-history, cl-lucid,
  cl-pcl, cl-clos and cl-flavors into your emacs/lisp source
  directory, or add the directory containing these files to the Emacs 
  variable load-path.  Then put these lines into your .emacs file:
      (setq *cl-program* <pathname-of-your-lisp-program>)
      (autoload 'run-cl "cl-shell" "" t)
  and type the command "M-x run-cl".  You can then get a list of key 
  bindings using "M-x describe-function cl-shell-mode".  To get proper
  Common Lisp indentations, you should also put the following line
  in your .emacs file:
      (setq lisp-indent-hook 'common-lisp-indent-hook)

cl-lucid.el, cl-clos.el, cl-pcl.el, cl-flavors.el - these provide
  extensions to the code in cl-shell.el.  They are all loaded
  automatically when you type "M-x run-cl" if the corresponding
  features are present in the CL world.  They allow the user to compile
  methods directly (i.e. not through a temp file) and to find
  source files of symbols with multiple definitions.

shell-history.el - a general command history mechanism for shell buffers.
  This is loaded by cl-shell.el.  You can also use it for other shells.

source-file-extensions.lisp - This file is an extensions to Lucid CL
  which records source-files for defvar, defparameter, defconstant,
  deftype, and the definition constructs in FLAVORS or PCL.  It is
  independent of the Emacs Lisp code described above, although it
  enhances its usefulness.

cl-obvius.el - This is an extension for running OBVIUS (Object-Based
  Vision and Image Understanding System), a Common Lisp program which
  is also available via anonymous ftp from whitechapel.media.mit.edu

completion.el, always-complete.el, advise.el - completion.el was
  written at Thinking Machines Corporation, and provides a very useful
  typing completion system for Emacs.  Advise.el is an advice system
  for Emacs Lisp, also written at Thinking Machines Corp.
  Always-complete.el, which requires advise.el and loads completion.el, 
  is an extension to completion.el written by Alan Ruttenberg at the MIT 
  Media Lab.  It prints the completions in the minibuffer as you type, 
  reminding you of their availability.  You can either load completion.el 
  by itself, or load always-complete.el (which loads completion.el).

misc-extensions.el - A few useful miscellaneous extensions to emacs.  
  Most useful are a mouse-click function which copies the s-expression
  at the mouse to the point, and code to fill comments correctly in
  lisp-mode.  This file does not set any key bindings -- it only defines
  a set of functions, and gives a list of (commented out) recommended
  key bindings.  This allows users to choose which of the extensions
  to use, by putting the appropriate key bindings in their .emacs files.

The source code is available, subject to the usual Emacs disclaimers,
as a compressed tar file via anonymous ftp:

whitechapel.media.mit.edu : pub/Emacs-cl-shell.tar.Z

Whitechapel's net address is 18.85.0.125.  After uncompressing the
file, you can list its contents with "tar tvf Emacs-cl-shell.tar" and
extract the files with "tar xvf Emacs-cl-shell.tar".
