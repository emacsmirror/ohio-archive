Quite a while ago I posted my mighty-mouse.el file with various mouse
support routines. Several people have asked me for the other files that I
mentioned in the comments, so I figured I might as well go ahead and post
them as well. The info-mouse stuff is the most useful, but I did not write
it, I simply adapted it to use the separate mouse maps that mighty-mouse.el
provides (Bob Weiner is the original author). Bob has since posted newer
versions of his info support, but this is based on an older version. (This
unfortunate divergence is one reason I did not want to post this stuff
originally, but I have gotten a lot of requests, so you will just have to
take this as-is).
