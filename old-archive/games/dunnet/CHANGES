Changes to dunnet for version 2:

Very few changes to game content except for the movement of one
object which makes the game a little easier, and a small section added.
Not really worth playing again if you have already finished it.

Fixed to work with version 19 keymaps.

Many bugfixes and code style fixes.

Spelling fixes.

Now uses rot13 instead of /bin/crypt to encrypt the saved games and
global data.

You can now write over old saved files.

In dunnet.window it now correctly fixes the screen when it would have
jump-scrolled the screen up before.

You can now type random control characters in batch mode without it 
erroring out (not control-c).

Old saved games are incompatible.
