Thu Mar  4 18:29:39 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* General bug fixes
* Support for lucid emacs.  Pull down menus, pop-up menus, dialog
  boxes.  (Ok, so I was bored)

Tue Mar  2 08:02:21 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added automatic bug submission form.

Mon Mar  1 10:45:37 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* New function metaserver-open-stream that is either homegrown for
  telnet or fset to open-network-stream depending on the value of
  metaserver-use-telnet.
* Added variable for whether to use telnet or native open-network
  stream.  For people who can't resolve host names very well.

Sat Feb 27 17:07:51 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added auto-detect of an rsa server.  If you aren't in RSA mode, it
  will ask if you want to use the rsa client instead of the normal
  one. 
* Added error handling to the open-network-stream call.  If the
  connection to the metaserver is timed out, will automatically try to
  use the metaserver-save-file.

Thu Feb 25 08:16:08 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Tweaked makefile
* Can now call metaserver-restore-from-file instead of
  metaserver-refresh to start the metaserver.  Suggested by Alec
  Habig.  (ahabig@riscgs1.lngs.infn.it)
* Fixed metaserver-restore-from-file so that it would redisplay
  information correctly.  Thanks to Alec Habig
  (ahabig@riscgs1.lngs.infn.it) for pointing out it didn't work.
* Fixed info-grabbing function so it doesn't infinite loop on occasion

Fri Feb 19 11:58:37 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed makefile so it will create a .emacs file.

Thu Feb 18 12:06:52 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Release V2.25
* Added a Makefile - no support for creating .emacs file yet.

Sat Feb  6 15:57:44 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added auto-documentation functions.  Takes a list of functions to
  find in a specified keymap, and a list of variables.  Spits out a
  buffer containing the keystrokes to get to the functions, along with
  the functions' doc strings.  Followed by a list of the variables and
  their doc strings.

Thu Feb  4 10:14:50 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed yet another stupid bug in the player checking code when it
  falls back to the metaserver.

Tue Feb  2 08:21:57 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed metaserver-suspend so that it actually works now.
* Fixed stupid bug in player checking code.  If falling back, would
  give you an error.  (Forgot the (substring 0 before a function call.)
* Added support to save the current metaserver information, in case
  the metaserver goes down.  This way you can still use the pinging,
  get information, etc.  Suggested by: Alec Habig
  (ahabig@riscgs1.lngs.infn.it)

Thu Jan 28 16:48:16 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-suspend - bury buffer on keypress.

Tue Jan 26 08:41:25 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added code to try the metaserver port 3522 if auto-fallback is true
  and the check players code did not work.

Mon Jan 25 10:49:38 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-tally-players to show the # of people playing/queued.

Fri Jan 22 17:58:40 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Fixed weird buffer-selection after info was fetched and before
  metaserver-mode was entered.
* Reworked parts of the server information (mostly cosmetic)
* Release v2.0

Thu Jan 21 07:07:37 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-rsa-binary, and RSA mode.
* Reworked lots of functions to use rsa-binary if RSA is active.
* Changed metaserver-binary-alist to include an rsa-binary.

Tue Jan 19 18:32:27 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

* Added code to display the server information that is gathered from
  port 3524 on the metaserver.
* Added metaserver-auto-fallback variable.  If true, try to use the
  ck_players program to get a player list when a server is not responding
  to the port -1 query.

Jan 11 17:40:06 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added code to automatically kill the network stream when the
  trailing lines are received.  (Thanks to peyote@umiacs.UMD.EDU for
  calling this to my attention and a way to patch it)

Jan 9 09:23:05 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-binary-alist to allow diff. binaries for diff. servers
* Had to change run-netrek function to check the alist, use defaults
  if not found, etc.
* Revised documentation file, and doc strings in elisp file.
* Fixed bug in the check players code that would insert the first
  keystroke after a failed query into a different buffer.
* Wrote a shell script to help installation to help byte compile/etc the
  file for people new to emacs.

Jan  1 12:09:05 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-site-order to allow ascending or descending sort
  for servers.
* Can now check player list via the port -1 query.

November 30 23:00:12 1992  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Changed ping to include min/avg/max round-trip packet time.
* Changed run-netrek to use either background or spawn its own process.

November  1 10:05:22 1992  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Complete rewrite.
* Doesn't kill its buffers anymore when refreshing, process-filters work
* Doesn't need to re-query the server when listing all servers, now
  keep 2 lists, one of empty servers, one of open.
* Updated the filters/sentinels so could now support MS-I output with
  some regular expression hacking.  
* No longer timestamps the buffer.
* Doesn't use background.el package.
* Fine tuning just about everywhere else.
* Pinging works, but not round-trip figures yet.  Just packet loss.

September 11 05:35:12 1992  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* No longer needs an external program to connect to the metaserver.
* First public release
