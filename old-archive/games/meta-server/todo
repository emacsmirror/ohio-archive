1. Add code to get player list directly from metaserver if ck_players
   program is not available.

2. Add checking for RSA servers (check "FLAGS" data field for an 'r')
   If not found and in RSA mode, ask for confirmation before running
   the RSA client.  If found and not in RSA mode, ask if they want to
   use the RSA client instead.
