  metaserver-mode was entered.

Thu Jan 21 07:07:37 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-rsa-binary, and RSA mode.

Tue Jan 19 18:32:27 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)

* Added code to display the server information that is gathered from
  port 3524 on the metaserver.
* Added metaserver-auto-fallback variable.  If true, try to use the
  ck_players program to get a player list when a server is not responding
  to the port -1 query.

Jan 11 17:40:06 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added code to automatically kill the network stream when the
  trailing lines are received.  (Thanks to peyote@umiacs.UMD.EDU for
  calling this to my attention and a way to patch it)

Jan 9 09:23:05 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-binary-alist to allow diff. binaries for diff. servers
* Had to change run-netrek function to check the alist, use defaults
  if not found, etc.
* Revised documentation file, and doc strings in elisp file.
* Fixed bug in the check players code that would insert the first
  keystroke after a failed query into a different buffer.
* Wrote a shell script to help installation to help byte compile/etc the
  file for people new to emacs.

Jan  1 12:09:05 1993  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Added metaserver-site-order to allow ascending or descending sort
  for servers.
* Can now check player list via the port -1 query.

November 30 23:00:12 1992  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Changed ping to include min/avg/max round-trip packet time.
* Changed run-netrek to use either background or spawn its own process.

November  1 10:05:22 1992  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* Complete rewrite.
* Doesn't kill its buffers anymore when refreshing, process-filters work
* Doesn't need to re-query the server when listing all servers, now
  keep 2 lists, one of empty servers, one of open.
* Updated the filters/sentinels so could now support MS-I output with
  some regular expression hacking.  
* No longer timestamps the buffer.
* Doesn't use background.el package.
* Fine tuning just about everywhere else.
* Pinging works, but not round-trip figures yet.  Just packet loss.

September 11 05:35:12 1992  William M. Perry  (wmperry@indiana.edu)
* No longer needs an external program to connect to the metaserver.
* First public release
