This is my emacs mud client.  This is NOT designed to be simple for
emacs novices!  It was designed for my own use, but I figured that
I should document things and let other people have a chance to use it.
Novices can probably get things going by just defining a list of
servers, but adding aliases and stuff won't be easy.

Two files besides this are included:

  muddy.el       - the client
  muddy-init.el  - sample configuration

Instructions on use are at the top of muddy.el.

If you find it useful, a short line letting me know would be
nice (as well as amazing me, since I expect everyone to dump
it immediately).  Also, send along nifty aliases and actions,
additions, simplified interfaces, and so forth.
