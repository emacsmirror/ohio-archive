;Subject: mapping replace commands
;
;Here's a package that's been languishing for a couple of years.  I find
;these commands invaluable but as yet none of my colleagues has found a
;use for them.  To these people I can only say "God often gives walnuts
;to toothless people." :-)  Anyway, here they are, make up your own minds.
;
;Instructions and a couple of usage examples are at the top of the file.

;; Mapping replace commands allow the replacements of instances or
;; groups of instances of a string or regexp match to be taken
;; sequentially from a series of replacements.
;;
;; For example, suppose you had this line
;;   (define-key vm-mode-map "0" 'digit-argument)
;; and you wanted to duplicate this 9 times except that the 0 should be
;; replaced with the digits 1-9.  The duplication is easy, just kill the
;; line and yank it back 10 times.  But getting the digits right requires
;; manual editing, unless you have mapping replace commands.  With the
;; command mapreplace-string you could put the cursor before the first
;; yanked line, and say
;;   M-x mapreplace-string RET
;;   0 RET
;;   0 SPC 1 SPC 2 SPC 3 SPC 4 SPC 5 SPC 6 SPC 7 SPC 8 SPC 9 RET
;; and the job is done.
;;
;; If you were setting up two keymaps and had ten copies of these two lines
;;   (define-key vm-mode-map "0" 'digit-argument)
;;   (define-key vm-summary-mode-map "0" 'digit-argument)
;; you would do the same as in the first example except you'd type
;;   C-u 2
;; before it all to give a prefix argument of two.  This gets every two
;; 0's found replaced by a 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.
;; 
;; This package is autoloadable.  Use
;;    (autoload 'mapreplace-string "mapreplace" nil t)
;;    (autoload 'mapreplace-regexp "mapreplace" nil t)
