Uh-oh - I blurbed again. Following some helpful suggestions from RMS,
please note that all e-lisp code posted by me in the last few days is
subject to the following copyright:
	
	Copyright (C) Schlumberger Cambridge Research, 1989

although as previously noted, under the same conditions as the GNU public
license. I'd like that to have my name there, but contracts are
contracts :-(

Sorry for the confusion, and I'm not on the list any more either ...
