		  *** Introducing: Gnu-Ada Mode ***
			     Release 1.05
I have integrated a set of programs to support ada development under
Gnu Emacs.  They support reasonable automatic indentation, two kinds of
template facilities, access to an online ada language reference manual,
automatic file header maintenance, and lots of other neat stuff.

I have another set of programs specifically for the verdix
environment.  With these, you may compile, make, load, list units, etc
from either a file or a directory.  You may use 'next-error to step
through compiler messages with possible automatic lookup in the online
reference manual. There is an interactive interface to a.db that is
roughly equivalent to "visual mode".  Emacs will also use the verdix tags.

Some who have used both set of programs report a 50% productivity gain
during ada coding sessions.  This is probably over optomistic, but
the productivity gain can be great.

These modes incorperate many of the Ada efforts of other people
(particularly Vincent Broman, Richard Stallman and S. Litvintchuck)
but are better integrated with each other and have been greatly
expanded in some areas. Vincent Broman is still actively supporting
his portions.

Most of these features could probably be ported to other ada
environments.  I am willing to integrate support for other development
environments but cannot develop it myself as I have only Verdix.
Vincent Broman has started Alysys support, but it is not ready for
general distribution.

I have tested the previous release against voluntering beta sites;
this release should be useable by the general public. The vender
independent parts of this release will probably be distributed in
release 19 of gnu emacs. Those with previous releases should upgrade.

The distribution is available in any of three forms
1. A complete distribution is available via FTP on spam.istc.sri.com
   under pub/gnu/gnu-ada1.05.tar.Z.  I will keep this updated after every
   set of significant changes.  Many thanks to Bill Wohler
   <wohler@spam.istc.sri.com>! 
2. A 4 part mailing of uuencoded compressed tar files.
3. A many part mailing of each individual file. Please only request
   this as a last resort.  
For mailings, send requests to lrs@esl.com

I am trying to keep track of all users so that I can distribute
updates, bug notices, and bug fixes.  If you ftp the source, please
let me know to add you to my ada users mailing list.

Copyrights: All of what I did is covered by a standard copyleft.  Some
of what I worked from was either in the public domain or was
copylefted. I am not sure about the source of the BNF based templates.
All code seems to be clearly based upon Gnu emacs.  If any of the
above features seem familar to you, please let me know. Any
information about copyright status would be greatly appreciated.

Happy Hacking -- Lynn
