Package for ZMACS functionality with GNU Emacs and Common Lisp

This Interface includes functions to provide many features found on
a lisp machine and many other useful features.  It was designed for
working with DOMAIN/CommonLISP on APOLLO workstations although it 
should not be a major job to port it to other systems.  This should
also work with other LUCID Common Lisp systems under X windows.

This may be ftp'd from prep.ai.mit.edu.
The file is emacs/apollo_emacs_support.tar.Z .

Many features in this package are useful even if you are not working
with Common Lisp.

Completion menus are now mouse sensitive, command history and
yanking has been defined for minibuffer eval-expression, shell modes,
inferior-lisp mode and yanked symbols can now be specified as only 
those matching some pattern.

Many of the functions that work with emacs lisp have also been made
to work with inferior-lisp as well as adding other features for non-lisp
users.  Where possible, all new functions for working with inferior-lisp
have been extended to work with emacs lisp and vice versa.

Incremental Compilation for inferior lisp and emacs lisp is available.
For common lisp, forms will be compiled in proper packages.

Inferior shell command completion exists for inferior-lisp and unix shells.

Real Attribute Lists for Mode, Package, Base, IBase, Readtable, Syntax etc.
can be used with inferior lisp.

Sectionized buffers and querying of inferior lisp process can be used to 
find source code for definitions.

Inferior lisp maintains command history so previous forms can be yanked
to current input line.

Many commands exist for querrying about inferior lisp forms.

List Notifications can be used to look at past messages.

Commands exist for operating on only changed lisp definitions.

The following is a list of most commands available from this environment:

  apollo:mouse-move-mark
