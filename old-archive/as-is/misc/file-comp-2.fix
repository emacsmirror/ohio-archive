I "fixed" it by putting the line:

          (kill-buffer "*Help*")

at the end of shell-filename-complete, thusly:

		 (message "Making completion list...")
		 (let ((list (all-completions partial-name completion-list)))
		   (with-output-to-temp-buffer "*Help*"
		     (display-completion-list list))
		   (message "Making completion list... done")))))
      (progn
	(message "No such file or directory")
	(ding))))
  (kill-buffer "*Help*"))
  
Seems to work, but I'm not a
Lisp hacker. Can anyone tell me if I did something silly and/or dangerous?
