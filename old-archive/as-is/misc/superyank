Subject: SUPERYANK.EL (Latest Version 1.1) [Article 1 of 2]

Source-Info:  From (or Sender) name not authenticated.


A while back, I posted an elisp package called "superyank" which can
be used to yank messages into reply and followup buffers for both
RMAIL and GNUS modes.  I have received many comments, suggestions and
some bug reports from people using superyank and have modified the
code based on their suggestions.  The diffs were substantial enough
that I decided to post the whole file (:-), David), with thanks to
everyone who contacted me concerning superyank.

Major changes from previous version:

1) some user definable variables have been renamed:

	sy-nested-citation  becomes sy-nested-citation-p
	sy-confirm-always   becomes sy-confirm-always-p
	sy-downcase         becomes sy-downcase-p
	sy-left-justify     becomes sy-left-justify-p
	sy-auto-fill-region becomes sy-auto-fill-region-p

2) some user definable variables have been added:

	sy-rewrite-header-hook allows you to custom modify your own
		informative headers, or ignore the headers altogether.

	sy-use-only-preference-p is added. It was referenced in version
		1.0 (as sy-use-only-preference) but never defvar'd.

3) mail-yank-ignored-headers has been expanded to ignore most headers I've
	seen for RMAIL and GNUS messages.

4) added the idea of a persistant attribution which is really the last
	attribution string selected by the user.  Its use is described
	below.

5) Improved the interaction with GNUS replies and followups through
	some internal changes.

6) Improved sy-fill-paragraph-manually (C-c q and C-c C-q) so that if
	you are manually filling a paragraph that doesn't all start with
	the same attribution string, the persistant attribution is
	assumed.

7) Added function sy-insert-persist-attribution (C-c i and C-c C-i)
	that will insert the persistant attribution string at the
	beginning of the line containing point.

8) Added function sy-open-line (C-c C-o) which works just like
	open-line (C-o) except that it inserts the persistant attribution
	string at the beginning of the opened line.

That's all I can think of, though performance has been improved in
many of the functions, transparent to the user.  The sy-open-line
function, combined with sy-fill-paragraph-manually is *very* useful
and the custom headers are also nice, so version 1.1 is worth getting.

I've also included a diff file that modifies emacs/lisp/rnewspost.el.
It seems there was a problem in GNUS followups where you'd get a line
at the bottom of the buffer saying "In article blah, so-and-so
writes:" and this is because GNUS uses a function in rnewspost.el that
explicitly writes this message.  In keeping with superyank's custom
header style hook, I just added a hook to the news-reply-original
function called `news-reply-header-hook' and made it do the expected
thing when using GNUS replies without superyank.  Superyank redefines
this hook to nil so that this bogus header won't get written when
using superyank.  This diff is not essential, but if you don't apply
it, you'll have to remove the bogus header manually.

Anyway, at the bottom of this posting you'll find the diff to
rnewspost.el and in an accompanying posting you find superyank 1.1.
As always, send comments, suggestions, bug reports, etc, to me, the
author.  Enjoy!
