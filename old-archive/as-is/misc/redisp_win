Subject: A suggested change for GNU Emacs.
To: info-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu


There is one place inside of GNU Emacs where the variable
'scroll-step' is ignored: when an insert is done that causes the point
to move off the screen, the screen always gets recentered irrespective
of the setting of 'scroll-step'.  This occurs in several different
places: in the 'insert' function; when process output goes into a
buffer; and probably elsewhere.  I find this to be rather annoying.
So, I dug through the source code for version 18.52 and found where
the "problem" occurs (if it indeed is a problem).  It's in the file
xdisp.c in the function redisplay_window().  Here is the short set of
context diffs for a proposed "fix" of this "problem":

  recenter:
!   pos = *vmotion (point, - height / 2, width, hscroll, window);
    try_window (window, pos.bufpos);
  
    startp = marker_position (w->start);
--- 748,756 ----
    /* Finally, just choose place to start which centers point */
  
  recenter:
!   pos = *vmotion (point,
! 		  scroll_step > 0 ? scroll_step - height : - height / 2,
! 		  width, hscroll, window);
    try_window (window, pos.bufpos);
  
    startp = marker_position (w->start);
----------------- diffs end here -----------------

This change causes the window to scroll to the center if scroll-step is <= 0;
otherwise, it scrolls by the number of lines in scroll-step.

This "fix" is just a suggestion ... it may be that such a thing is
undesirable or else that I didn't properly "fix" the problem at all.
Please take these diffs only as a suggestion for a future change
rather than the final word on the subject.

What do some of you think about this?
