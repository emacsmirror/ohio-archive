Subject: RMAIL enhancement; send message to printer (really, process)
Cc: jr@pineapple.bbn.com


This is a gross hack, borne of desperation (aren't they all?).  It adds
a new command the RMAIL-MODE.  The | key sends the current message to
as to a process as stdin.  The command is in rmail-print-command.
We use the "mp" command to print mail messages.

Please, please, someone take this and do it the right way -- it's got
duplicate code, it should be in rmailout.el, etc.

Hope someone fixes it and finds it useful.
