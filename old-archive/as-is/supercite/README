This is the distribution of SUPERCITE 2.0, an elisp utility to do nice
citing of reply messages for GNUemacs.

supercite.el is the main file containing the citing functions, it
calls functions defined in baw-alist.el so be sure both are on your
load-path.

supercite 2.0 should run as is with VM 4.37+ after you make the hook
bindings as described in the documentation.  To run it with RMAIL
(emacs 18.54 & 18.55), or with GNUS 3.12, you need to either install
the sendmail and rnewspost context diffs, or use the overload
functions in sc-misc.el.  To run it with mh-e, also either install the
context diff or use the overload function.

Once you've got it installed and loaded, you can type "M-x sc-describe"
to get documentation on how to use it.  Below I've included the
pertinent information from the documentation on how to link supercite
in with the mail/news reader of your choice.

==from supercite.el==============================

Finally, some discussion on how to interface supercite with the
various mail/news readers you might be using is in order.  This
discussion is also useful for those who might be writing a mail/news
reader and want to let your users take advantage of Supercite.

The author runs a Supercite mailing list on which a number of
mail/news reader authors and other Supercite users participate.  A
while back some discussion was held and an interface between these
readers and Supercite was agreed upon.  The ancestor to this package,
SUPERYANK 1.11 was designed along an old inteface and this package,
SUPERCITE 2.0 conforms to this new standard.  As of the date of this
writing (12-Oct-1989) only VM 4.37 conforms to this standard as
distributed. GNUS 3.12, RMAIL and MH-E all use functions distributed
with EMACS 18.55 and patches are available to the appropriate files,
distributed along with Supercite as: 

     {rnewspost,sendmail,mh-e}.el.diff

If you do not want to install the diffs, or are not able to install
them, check the file sc-misc.el.  This file contains overload
functions which can be selectively loaded to provide the necessary
functionality.  If you decide to go the overload route, be sure to set
`sc-load-hook' to something like:

     (setq sc-load-hook '(lambda () (load \"sc-misc\")))

The variables controlling overloading should be rather self
explanatory in the sc-misc.el file.  This file also contains some
miscellaneous extension to RMAIL. Also, in superyank version 1.11, the
function `mail-yank-original' was overloaded and bound to \"\\C-c
\\C-y\". This functionality is provided in this release, but will no
longer be supported.

Now, with Supercite version 2.0, a hook is provided called
`mail-yank-hooks' which is run *after* the text is yanked.  This way,
the particular mail/news reader handles setting up the reply buffer
and yanking the appropriate text into the buffer, but leaves citing
the lines up to external functions. Most readers will provide a simple
citation function hooked in by default, for those who haven't yet
discovered this superior citation package.  Mh-e users should use
`mh-yank-hooks' instead of `mail-yank-hooks'.  For these to work you
must have installed diffs to {rnewspost,sendmail,mh-e}.el or used the
overloaded functions supplied in sc-misc.el.

The mail/news reader should put the verbose mail headers at the top of
the yanked text and leave POINT at the beginning of the headers.  MARK
should point to the end of the yanked text.  Then it should run
`mail-yank-hooks'.

Add some of this code to your .emacs file to use supercite 2.0:

     (autoload 'sc-cite-original \"supercite\" \"Hookified Supercite 2.0\" t)
     (autoload 'sc-cite          \"supercite\" \"Interactive Supercite 2.0\" t)
     (autoload 'sc-describe      \"supercite\" \"Describe Supercite 2.0\" t)
     (setq mail-yank-hooks 'sc-cite-original)
     (setq mh-yank-hooks 'sc-cite-original)
