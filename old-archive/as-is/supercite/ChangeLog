		* Shar it up and post.

		* moved supercite-misc.el to sup-misc.el and
		baw-alist-utils.el to baw-alist.el for sake of users of
		bogus UN*X's which can't handle long file names.

		* Merged in mh-e support as provided by Mark Baushke.

Thu Oct 12 17:50:55 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Fixed small bug in sc-populate-alists. No space was being
		put between last middlename and lastname.

		* Cleaned up documentation. Ready to post tomorrow.

Wed Oct 11 13:43:35 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Moved sc-supercite to sc-describe.

		* Cleaned up code and documentation for distribution. I'll be
		watching for bugs to pop up before release.

		* Added sc-leached-keymap for better documentation.

		* Changed default value of sc-cite-regexp to include possible
		whitespace around attribution text and mulitple ">" characters.

		* Changed all symbol prefixes from sy- to sc- in both the
		supercite.el and supercite-misc.el files.

		* Added cute hack so that description of supercite bindings are
		leached onto the docstring of the current buffer's major-mode
		function.  "C-h m" after supercite is loaded will show the
		supercite keybindings in the *Help* buffer.

Tue Oct 10 17:30:32 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Fixed a bug in the creation of the "sc-author" field which was
		putting a bogus space at the end of the author's name. Also added
		all the other name fields to the "sc-gal-information" alist. You
		can now access "sc-firstname", "sc-lastname", and all
		"sc-middlename-N".

		* Added an attribution style that I use.
		sc-header-attributed-writes. 

		* Parameterized the ">>>>>" prefix on the reference header. Some
		people find this annoying, I like it.

Sun Oct  8 22:08:11 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Added binding for sc-insert-reference for mh-e mode.

Wed Oct  4 18:54:43 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Fixed bug in searching for author names in certain From: lines
		which didn't find names with dots (abbreviations) and dashes.

		* Added per-interface keymaps which allow you to define different
		keybindings based on the major-mode of the buffer which supercite
		is leaching onto.

Tue Oct  3 20:01:17 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Fixed bug in sc-{re,un}cite which bombed out if first line in
		region was blank. These functions now search for attribution
		prefix on first non-blank line in region.

Mon Sep 25 10:30:32 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Modified diffs and overloads to mh-e stuff as per ks and mdb

		* Fixed conditional loads in supercite-misc.el

		* Added (require 'sendmail)

Thu Sep 21 10:17:23 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Posted 2.0gamma to supercite list.

		* Added overload functions to supercite-misc.el

		* Fixed some bugs in electric-reference functions

		* After citing a yanked region, leave point (or mark if
		point>mark) on first non-blank line.

Wed Sep 13 18:10:45 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Added electric reference header selection. Now you don't have to
		remember which integer pointed to which reference style!

Tue Sep 12 18:23:47 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Fixed some bugs in paragraph filling and made the whole thing
		more robust and simple.

		* Added exchange of point and mark when point > mark.  Exchange is
		only visible internal to sc- functions.  Order of point and mark
		are restored after citing.

		* Added some new mail headers to clean.

Wed Sep  6 18:45:11 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

Fri Sep  1 18:37:59 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Modified documentation and updated the public domain notice.

		* Restored "C-c q" binding of sc-fill-paragraph-manually.

Tue Aug 29 18:54:27 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Added sc-modify-info function.

		* Fixed sc-left-justify-p to use fixup-whitespace (which makes
		more sense).

Mon Aug 21 10:07:06 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Posted 2.0beta version to mailing list.

		* Added sc-uncite function.

Fri Aug 18 16:49:43 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Split files for managability.

Thu Aug 17 21:43:33 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Added alist utilites and rewrote major portions of code to
		utilize these association lists for keeping track of important
		information.

Mon Aug 14 17:09:11 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Added facility to remember which attribution was last used. This
		last used attribution is presented to the user as the preferred
		choice for the next attribution.

Mon Jul 31 18:52:41 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Modified some documentation.

Thu Jul 27 17:01:49 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Added some better filling functions and hookified the paragraph
		fill function so you can use whatever you want.

Wed Jul  5 21:15:45 1989  Barry Warsaw  (warsaw at rtg)

		* Totally rewrote version 2.0 based on superyank 1.11.  This
		included major modifications of almost every bit of code in the
		package. Much too numerous to mention here.
