;;; MODIFICATION HISTORY:

;;; Ashwin Ram      ARPA:    Ram-Ashwin@cs.yale.edu
;;;                 UUCP:    ...!{decvax, linus, seismo}!yale!Ram-Ashwin
;;;                 BITNET:  Ram@yalecs
;;; Added variable to control embedded word checking (nice in troff but a pain otherwise).
;;; 10/26/87.
;;; Interactive word completion.
;;; 8/14/87.
;;; Detex before checking spelling.
;;; Made options more mnemonic, prompt and error messages better.
;;; Added highlighting of misspelled word.
;;; Query-replace all occurrences of misspelled word through buffer.
;;; Allow customization of personal dictionary.
;;; Moved temporary file to /tmp.
;;; Added check for dead ispell process to avoid infinite loop.
;;; Avoid repeated querying for same word in same buffer.
;;; 7/6/87.

;;; ispell-region and associated routines added by
;;; Perry Smith
;;; pedz@bobkat
;;; Tue Jan 13 20:18:02 CST 1987

;;; extensively modified by Mark Davies and Andrew Vignaux
;;; {mark,andrew}@vuwcomp
;;; Sun May 10 11:45:04 NZST 1987

;;; Depends on the ispell program snarfed from MIT-PREP in early 1986.

;;; To fully install this, add this file to your GNU lisp directory and 
;;; compile it with M-X byte-compile-file.  Then add the following to the
;;; appropriate init file:
;;; 
;;; (autoload 'ispell-word "ispell" "Check spelling of word at or before point" t)
;;; (autoload 'ispell-complete-word "ispell" "Complete word at or before point" t)
;;; (autoload 'ispell-region "ispell" "Check spelling of every word in the region" t)
;;; (autoload 'ispell-buffer "ispell" "Check spelling of every word in the buffer" t)
;;; You might want to bind ispell-word and ispell-complete word to keys.

;;; If run on a heavily loaded system, the initial sleep time in
;;; ispell-init-process may need to be increased.

; This routine has certain limitations brought about by the filter
; hook.  For example, deroff will take ``\fBcat\fR'' and spit out
; ``cat''.  This is hard to search for since word-search-forward will
; not match at all and search-forward for ``cat'' will match
; ``concatenate'' if it happens to occur before.
; `ispell-region' filters the region into `*ispell-temp*', writes the
; buffer to a temporary file, and sends a ``&Include_File&foobar''
; string to the ispell process which is writing into `*ispell*'.
; `ispell-region' then searches `*ispell*' for a spelling error (`#' or
; `&'), checks the `*ispell-temp*' buffer for the misspelled word and
; then skips forward `count' words (the number of correct lines in
; `*ispell*') in the region.  It then searches for the misspelled
; word.  This is not a foolproof heuristic but it is fast and works
; most of the time.
; ... with the unfortunate side-effect that it will sometimes
; pick up the same string in other words too (e.g. if you had the word "food"
; near the "\fIfoo\fP" that you were looking for).
; Another disadvantage is that your "prefobnicator" (deroff or detex or
; whatever) can't delete too many words (and you can't run it through spell(1)
; to cut down on the number of words you want checked) because of the way this
; hack works.
; To get around this, you can setq the variable ispell-words-have-boundaries to
; t (for normal cases) and nil (for embedded-word texts such as for nroff/troff).
; In the first case, your prefobnicator can, for instance, do a "ispell -l" to cut
; down on the number of words you need to "ispell -a" (increasing the program's
; speed considerably).
