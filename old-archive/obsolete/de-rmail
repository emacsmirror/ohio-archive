Yes, VM is really nice.

I've helped all the people in my group switch over to VM from RMAIL, and
so wrote a script to do the conversion of BABYL to Unix mail file
format.  Here they are; they're slow and kludgy, but they get the job
done.  Note that you'll have to change the path in "de-rmailify"
appropriately.

(defun append-to-file (start end filename)
  "Append the contents of the region to the end of file FILENAME.
When called from a function, expects three arguments,
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are buffer positions
saying what text to write."
  (interactive "r\nFAppend to file: ")
  (write-region start end filename t 'quiet))

(let ((file-to-be-converted (buffer-file-name))
      (message-count 0)
      (rmail-delete-after-output t)
      (unix-style-file-name (concat (buffer-file-name) ".mail")))
  (kill-buffer (current-buffer))
  (rmail file-to-be-converted)
  (rmail-show-message 1)
  (while (not (rmail-output unix-style-file-name))
    (setq message-count (1+ message-count)))
  (rmail-quit))
-------------------- Emacs Lisp, "de-rmailify.el" ----------



So, for example, I typed

	de-rmailify RMAIL

and I got an empty RMAIL BABYL file, an RMAIL~ that was the old RMAIL,
and an RMAIL.mail which I then renamed to INBOX or mbox.

I then encountered the more hairy problem of converting users's
"~/mail/*" BABYL folders to Unix mail file format.  One user had a mail
directory that was four levels deep, with BABYL files at each level.  So
I hacked this together, which converted each BABYL file in the specified
directory in the same manner as above.  Doing appropriate deletions from
dired and then renaming all the *.mail files did the trick.


-------------------- Shell script, "de-rmailify-directory" ----------
#!/bin/csh
#
if ( $#argv != 1 ) then
	echo "Usage: de-rmailify-directory directory-name"
	exit
endif

find $1 -type f -print > /tmp/rmail-names$$

cd $1
foreach foo ( `cat /tmp/rmail-names$$` )
	grep ^BABYL $foo >& /dev/null && /usr/local/bin/emacs -batch $foo -l ~nate/gnu/de-rmailify.el -kill
end
-------------------- Shell script, "de-rmailify-directory" ----------


Hope this proves useful,
