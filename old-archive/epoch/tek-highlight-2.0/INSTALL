 Installation instructions for the tek-highlight group of packages.
 ====================================================================

You only need to do 4 or 5 things to install these packages:


1) Ensure you have all of the required packages installed.

If you want to use the tek-dired-highlight package, you must first
acquire Dave Gillespie's info package from the elisp archive:

	  GNU Emacs Lisp Code Directory Apropos -- "info-dg"
"~/" refers to archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/

info-dg (1.04)	      92-03-04
     Dave Gillespie, <daveg@synaptics.com>
     ~/modes/info.el.Z
     Info reader with many enhancements; replaces standard info.el.

The tek-dired-highlight package is known to work with info-dg version
1.04.

The tek-vm-highlight package is known to work with VM version 5.32.
VM can be obtained from your local GNU archive (look for
"vm-5.32.tar.Z").

The tek-gnus-highlight package is known to work with GNUS version
3.14.1.  GNUS can be obtained from your local GNU archive (look for
"gnus-3.14.1.tar.Z").

The tek-mh-e-highlight package is known to work with mh-e version
3.8 (i.e. the one distributed with Epoch version 4.0) with the
included patch applied.


2) If you are using epoch version 3.2 then apply the patch in
get-font.patch to your epoch sources and rebuild epoch. This bug has
been fixed in version 4.0.


3) Byte compile each of the .el files and put them somewhere in your
load path.


4) Add the following lines to your .emacs:


; Set up an autoload for syntax decoding stuff.
(autoload 'decode-syntax-table "syntax-decode" "autoloadable function" t)

; Highlight comments in source code
(require 'tek-src-highlight-setup)

; Customise the mouse drag style
(require 'tek-motion-highlight-setup)

; Set up for highlighting in dired.
(require 'tek-dired-highlight-setup)

; Set up for highlighting in info browser
(require 'tek-info-highlight-setup)

; Set up for highlighting in gnus.
(require 'tek-gnus-highlight-setup)

; Set up for highlighting in VM.
(require 'tek-vm-highlight-setup)

; Set up for highlighting under mh-e.
(require 'tek-mh-e-highlight-setup)


Obviously you can load just some of the packages and not others. The
syntax-decode package is used by tek-src-highlight, so you must include
the above autoload command if you are highlighting your comments.

It seems unlikely that you would want to use both VM and mh-e, so you
only need to load the setup for one of these.


5) If you want to use highlighting under mh-e you will need to install
a patched version of mh-e.el in your .../epoch/lisp directory, using
the patches in mh-e.patch. These are based on the version distributed
with epoch 4.0.


All the .el files will byte compile under emacs as well as under
epoch. We use make and "emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile" to release
byte compiled elisp files across our different machines.

The above packages all do something sensible when loaded under emacs,
so you don't need to worry about different .emacs'es for emacs and
epoch.
