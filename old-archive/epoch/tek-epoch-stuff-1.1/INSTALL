 Installation instructions for the tek-epoch-stuff group of packages.
 ====================================================================

You only need to do 4 or 5 things to install these packages:


1) If you are using epoch version 3.2 then apply the patch in
get-font.patch to your epoch sources and rebuild epoch. This bug has
been fixed in version 4.0.


2) Byte compile each of the .el files and put them somewhere in your
load path.


3) Set the value of the variable tek-highlight-use-attributes, based
on whether you are using epoch version 3.2 or 4. See the file
tek-style-utils.el for details. I recommend that you set this variable
in your .emacs, rather than editing tek-style-utils.el . This way you
will be able to upgrade to new versions of this package more easily.


4) Add the following lines to your .emacs:


; Set up an autoload for syntax decoding stuff.
(autoload 'decode-syntax-table "syntax-decode" "autoloadable function" t)

; Set up autoload of new manual browser
(require 'tek-man-setup)

; Set up autoload of new info browser
(require 'tek-info-setup)

; Highlight comments in source code
(require 'tek-src-hilite-setup)

; Customise the mouse drag style
(require 'tek-motion-setup)

; Set up for highlighting in gnus.
(require 'tek-gnus-hilite-setup)

; Set up for highlighting in VM.
(require 'tek-vm-hilite-setup)

; Set up for highlighting under mh-e.
(require 'tek-mh-e-hilite-setup)


Obviously you can load just some of the packages and not others. The
syntax-decode package is used by tek-src-hilite, so you must include
the above autoload command if you are highlighting your comments.

It seems unlikely that you would want to use both VM and mh-e, so you
only need to load the setup for one of these.


5) If you want to use highlighting under mh-e you will need to install
the patched version of mh-e.el in your .../epoch/lisp directory. If
you have made local mods to this file, you can instead apply the
patches in mh-e.patch. These are based on the version distributed with
epoch 4.0 .


All the .el files will byte compile under emacs as well as under
epoch. We use make and "emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile" to release
byte compiled elisp files across our different machines.

The above packages all do something sensible when loaded under emacs,
so you don't need to worry about different .emacs'es for emacs and
epoch.
