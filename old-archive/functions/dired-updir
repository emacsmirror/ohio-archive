Ok, here's yet another of my semi useful patches to emacs.  I used to
use a TI Explorer lisp machine alot.  I got used to Zmac's dired mode
which is really similar to gnuemacs's, but flashier in spots.  Anyway,
one of the things that I missed was the ability to go up a dir on a
keystroke.  (Unless I'm wrong, you have to go use f or v on the line
with the .. in it now)

So, this patch to dired.el will add the '<' key to go up a dir.  It's
really simple.

This patch should not affect anyone who doesn't use the < key in dired
so it's safe to apply to the system dired.el file (if you can write to
it).

Maybe this patch will be added to future versions of emacs.  It's
really trivial.
