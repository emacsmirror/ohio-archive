Hello, this is my mouse and menu package for GNU Emacs. 

It implements global and local mouse-maps for X and SunView, along
with per-buffer menus. Additionally, for those of you without
bitmapped screens, the menu facilities are available in "terminal"
form for use on the wide range of VDUs Emacs currently runs on. Sadly,
I cannot post the code that implements virtual pointing devices for
such systems :-).

The menu stuff gives the following:

  + menu-based help facilities 
  + optional keybinding reminders for menu items
  + a large set of default menus for
    - rmail and mail
    - dired
    - file and buffer manipulation
    - Emacs Lisp, other Lisps and PROLOG
    - text, TeX, LaTeX and BibTeX
    - shells and inferior processes

Hopefully the instructions and notes in INSTALL should cover any
queries, if not please UTSL first (use the source, Luke).

This directory should contain the following files:
