gnuserv, gnuclient, gnudoit \- Server and Clients for GNU Emacs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnuclient
[-q] [[-h hostname] [-p port] [-r pathname]] [[+line] path] ...

.B gnudoit 
[-q] [[-h hostname] [-p port]] [sexpr] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIgnuclient\fP allows the user to request a running GNU Emacs process to edit
the named files or directories.
.PP
\fIgnudoit\fP allows the user to request a running GNU Emacs process to
evaluate the given arguments inside a progn LISP form.
.PP
\fIgnuserv\fP is the server program that is set running by GNU Emacs to handle
all incoming and outgoing requests. It is not usually invoked directly, but is
started from GNU Emacs by the LISP form (server-start).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI \-q
This option informs both \fIgnuclient\fP and \fIgnudoit\fP to exit once
connection has been made with the GNU Emacs process. Normally \fIgnuclient\fP
waits until all of the files on the command line have been finished with
(their buffers killed) by the GNU Emacs process, and \fIgnudoit\fP normally
waits around for evaluation of its arguments by the GNU Emacs process, and
prints the results or error conditions.
.TP 8
.BI \-h " hostname"
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, this option specifies the host machine
which should be running \fIgnuserv\fP.  If this option is not specified then
the value of the environment variable GNU_HOST is used if set, otherwise the
hostname of the machine running the program is used.
.br
Note that an internet address may be specified instead of a hostname which can
speed up connections to the server by quite a bit, especially if the client
machine is running YP.
.br
Note also that a hostname of \fBunix\fP can be used to specify that the connection
to the server should use a Unix-domain socket (if supported) rather than an
Internet-domain socket.
.TP 8
.BI \-p " port"
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, this option specifies the service port
used to communicate between server and clients. If this option is not
specified, then the value of the environment variable GNU_PORT is used, if
set, otherwise a service called ``gnuserv'' is looked up
in the services database. Finally, if no other value can be found for the
port, then a default port is used which is usually 21490 + uid.
.br
Note that since \fIgnuserv\fP doesn't allow command-line options, the port for
it will have to be specified via one of the alternative methods.
.TP 8
.BI \-r " pathname"
Used only with Internet-domain sockets, the pathname argument may be needed to
inform GNU Emacs how to reach the root directory of a remote machine.
\fIgnuclient\fP prepends this string to each path argument given. For example,
if you were trying to edit a file on a client machine called otter, whose root
directory was accessible from the server machine via the path /net/otter, then
this argument should be set to '/net/otter'. If this option is omitted, then
the value is taken from the environment variable GNU_NODE, if set, or the
empty string otherwise.
.br
Note that on hp9000/s300 and hp9000/s800, the pathname, if not specified by
the user, is guessed.
.TP 8
.BI "path"
This is the path of the file to be edited. If the file is a directory, then
the directory browsers dired or monkey are usually invoked instead.
.TP 8
.BI "sexpr"
This is part of a GNU Emacs LISP expression to evaluate. All the sexprs are
concatenated together and wrapped in a progn form before sending to GNU Emacs.
.PP
.SH SETUP
In order to use the programs, the file gnuserv.el can be copied into a
directory on your GNU Emacs load-path, and loaded into GNU Emacs by the GNU
Emacs LISP form (load "gnuserv"). The server can then be started by the GNU
Emacs LISP form (server-start).
.SH EXAMPLE
.TP 8
gnudoit -q '(mh-smail)'
.TP 8
gnuclient -h otter -r /net/otter /tmp/*
.SH SYSV IPC
SysV IPC is used to communicate between \fIgnuclient\fP, \fIgnudoit\fP and
\fIgnuserv\fP if the symbol SYSV_IPC is defined at the top of gnuserv.h. This
is incompatible with both Unix-domain and Internet-domain socket communication
as described below. A file called /tmp/gsrv??? is created as a key for the
message queue, and if removed will cause the communication between server and
client to fail until the server is restarted.
.SH UNIX-DOMAIN SOCKETS
A Unix-domain socket is used to communicate between \fIgnuclient\fP,
\fIgnudoit\fP and \fIgnuserv\fP if the symbol UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS is defined
at the top of gnuserv.h.  A file called /tmp/gsrv??? is created for
communication and if deleted will cause communication between server and
client to fail.
.SH INTERNET-DOMAIN SOCKETS
Internet-domain sockets are used to communicate between \fIgnuclient\fP,
\fIgnudoit\fP and \fIgnuserv\fP if the symbol INTERNET_DOMAIN_SOCKETS is
defined at the top of gnuserv.h. Both Internet-domain and Unix-domain sockets
can be used at the same time.
.SH SECURITY
Using Internet-domain sockets, a more robust form of security is needed that
wasn't necessary with either Unix-domain sockets or SysV IPC.
.br
\fIgnuserv\fP performs a limited form of security at the machine level. By
default only connections from the host where the server is running will be
allowed. All other server connections will be rejected with a cryptic message
(which is displayed only by \fIgnudoit\fP). Alternatively, if the variable
GNU_SECURE can be found in \fIgnuserv\fP's environment, and it names a
readable filename, then this file is opened and assumed to be a list of hosts,
one per line, from which the server will allow requests. Note that a host may
be either a internet address, or a hostname. If this file contains a lot of
hostnames then the server may take quite a time to start up.
.SH KNOWN BUGS
If GNU Emacs attempts to send a string containing a newline character to
\fIgnuserv\fP, then \fIgnuserv\fP will die.
