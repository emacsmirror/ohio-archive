This file is not meant to be proper documentation. See the file gnuserv.1 for
more information.

To install, copy gnuserv.el into a directory on your GNU Emacs loadpath, copy
*.[ch1] into the GNU Emacs etc directory, patch etc/Makefile with
etc.Makefile.diff, then change directory to etc and type:

  make gnuserv gnuclient gnudoit

This should compile the server and the two clients. You may now want to put
gnuserv, gnuclient and gnudoit in the directory where you put etags and emacs.
