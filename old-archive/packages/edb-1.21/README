This is the README file for EDB, a database program for GNU Emacs.
The bulk of the EDB documentation is in the texinfo file database.texi.
EDB was written by Michael Ernst <mernst@theory.lcs.mit.edu>.


Files in EDB
============

(In lexographic order)

Makefile	Byte-compile, create documentation, etc., from the shell

README		This file:  manifest and installation instructions

README-example	README file for the separate EDB examples distribution

database.el	The main file; primarily loads other files

db-convert.el	Changing database structure:  add and remove fields, etc.

db-file-io.el	Saving databases to disk, loading databases from disk

db-format.el	Displaying and editing a single database record

db-interfa.el	Keystroke bindings, wrapper functions

db-isbn.el	ISBN type

db-isbntst.el	Test cases for ISBN type

db-rdb.el	Support for RDB databases

db-rep.el	Data abstractions and operations upon them

db-search.el	Searching and matching records

db-sort.el	Sorting records

db-summary.el	Summary buffer with limited info about every database record

db-tagged.el	Support for tagged database files

db-time.el	Definitions of time and date field types

db-two-dbs.el	Operations on two databases:  merging, comparing, etc.

db-types.el	Definitions of useful field types

db-util.el	Useful non-EDB specific utility functions

edb.texi	Texinfo documentation:  user manual

See below for how to get pre-processed copies of the documentation.


Installation
============

See edb-inst.texi for more complete and definitive instructions.

In short, place the .el files in your Emacs load path (probably in a
directory of their own).  You can add a directory to your Emacs lisp load
path by putting something similar to the following in your .emacs file:

	(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/emacs/edb") load-path))

In order to autoload EDB, put the following in your .emacs file:

	(autoload 'db-find-file "database" "EDB database package" t)

Use M-x db-find-file to start up EDB on a particular database file.

It is recommended that, lest it run very slowly, you byte-compile the code.
You can do so either by calling function byte-compile-database, or by
typing "make" to the shell in the EDB directory.

The texinfo documentation uses version 2 of texinfo, which is available
from prep.ai.mit.edu.  Earlier versions of texinfo will not properly format
the manual, either for TeX or for info.  If you don't have a sufficiently
up-to-date version of texinfo, you can simply get the files edb.dvi,
edb.ps, edb.info, and edb.info-[123456] (six files) from
theory.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/emacs/edb/; these are versions of the documentation
ready for printing and for use in info, respectively.  Likewise, you can
get edb-inst.{dbi,ps,info}.

Sample databases can be found in the file examples.tar.Z or the directory
examples, both in theory.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/emacs/edb/.
