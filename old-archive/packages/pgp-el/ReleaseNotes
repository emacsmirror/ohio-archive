This is version 197 of pgp.el, released Wed Aug  9 18:04:36 1995.
The last release was 190, released Jul 27 08:51.

There is only one substantive change in this release:  In the
last release, I provided new keybindings for the PGP functions,
conforming them to the GNU standard for minor-mode keybindings.
Unfortunately, after release, I realized that the keybindings I
had picked conflicted with those of supercite.  Since both
supercite and pgp are used when composing mail, this conflict is
a serious problem.

I have shifted the PGP keybindings to match mailcrypt's.  Since
the two packages do more or less the same thing, this seemed
natural, and mailcrypt's don't seem to conflict with anything
except picture mode (which is good about saving and restoring,
so you can in fact use it with pgp or mailcrypt).

Interesting changes from previous releases:

17-Jul.16:07   jackr     create version "../homeVob/emacs/pgp.el@@/main/190"

	Most of the configurable options (hopefully, all that
	make sense) can now have values nil, t, or 'ask.

	When reading a pubkey from a message, show it to the
	user before adding it, so s/he can reject it.

28-Jun.22:26   jackr     create version "../homeVob/emacs/pgp.el@@/main/176"

	Important security fix: no longer save cleartext and
	passphrases to world-readable files in /tmp/!
