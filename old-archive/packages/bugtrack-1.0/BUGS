Well, actually it is possible using the 'e' command. It is a bit
dangerous, though. Better commands should be created. Priority and
severity lowered. Maybe the headers should be read-only?

Caching the sumlin cookies would probably speed up the summary
functions.  On the other hand, there is the problem of invalidating
the cache...  This will have to wait for another release.

It is possible to type C-x C-s and save the current Bugtrack buffer
even before you exit bugtrack edit mode (wich C-c C-c).  This is not a
good think, especially not if you have accidentaly modified the
headers.

The solution is probably to make the headers read-only, using a text
property.  I can't think of an obvious solution.  Rebinding C-x C-s
doesn't solve the problem - there is still save-some-buffers, and
other similar functions.
