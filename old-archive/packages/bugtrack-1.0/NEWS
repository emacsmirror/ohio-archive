New features in bugtrack 1.0 (1993-12-13)
-----------------------------------------

This is the first release made to a wider audience, and also the first
release that gets a release number.

+ Tighter coupling to RMAIL: hit "F" in RMAIL mode to search for bug
  reports that refer to the current mail.

+ The new file bugtrack-init.el should be loaded from your .emacs (or,
  possibly, from default.el).  It is no longer necessary to load
  bugtrack.el before rmail.el to get the RMAIL coupling to work.

+ As a bonus, added bugtrack-rmail-view-commented (bound to "^" in
  RMAIL mode).

- Emacs 18 is no longer supported.
