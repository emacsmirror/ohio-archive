This is the README file for Bugtrack 1.0.


Bugtrack is...
--------------

Bugtrack is a support system for tracking bug reports.  As a new
bug report arrive, you create a ``bug'', assigning it a priority,
severity and difficulty.  The bug reports are collected in folders,
much like RMAIL folders.  You can get a summary of the bug reports,
sorted by priority, severity, difficulty or chronological.  The
summary normally excludes ``closed'' bugs, but if you give a prefix
argument the summary will also include inactive bug reports.

Bugtrack is tightly coupled to RMAIL.  When you receive a bug
report, you only have to press ``C'' and answer a few questions to
create the bug.  Later on, you can find the email that corresponds
to the bug with a single keystroke.  More than one email can be
associated with a bug, making it easy to review all emails about
this particular bug when you finally decide to do something about
it.

Bugtrack is distributed under the GNU General Public License.


Bugtrack is not...
------------------

Bugtrack probably does not work very well in development groups.  You
will have to rely on Emacs file locking.  You cannot store this file
under e.g. CVS -- if two developpers simultaneously create a bug
report it is not easy to merge the revisions (you have to change the
bug id manually).  If you work on your own on a project, or if it is
your responsibility to handle the bug reports and distribute them
among the programmers, this will probably be useful for you.


Feedback
--------

Send bug reports to ceder@lysator.liu.se.

If there is enough interrest I will create a mailing list for bugtrack
related questions.  Send mail to ceder@lysator.liu.se if you want to
be added to it.

Bugtrack requires FSF GNU Emacs 19.x.  I don't know if it works with
Lucid GNU Emacs.  See bugtrack.el for installation instructions.  See
COPYING for copying conditions.  See NEWS for info about recent
changes.  See BUGS for an example Bugtrack file.

If you evaluate this package and decide that it is *not* useful for
you, please tell me why, so that I can either improve Bugtrack or add
a warning message to future releases, so that other people don't have
to waste as much time on figuring out if this package suits them.

I hope you enjoy this package.
