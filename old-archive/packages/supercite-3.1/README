WELCOME TO SUPERCITE VERSION 3.1  -- 1993/09/22 22:00:15

README revision: 3.11

What you have in your hands is the release of Supercite version 3.1, which
represents an almost complete rewrite from version 2.3.  This README file
contains a brief overview and a quick guide to getting connected for those
of you who don't like to read manuals.  More detail is provided in the
Texinfo manual, which you can format and read with:

	% texi2dvi supercite.texi

This produces a .dvi file which you can read with xdvi or convert to
PostScript and printout on a compatible printer with dvi2ps.  All this
assumes you have the latest GNU texinfo release (3.1) and TeX 3.  If you
don't have TeX, just add the file to your info tree.  Consult the Emacs
documentation to find out how to do this.

MANIFEST
========

This package should include the following files:

regi.el (1.8)         -- REGular expression Interpreting engine.
reporter.el (1.23)    -- Bug report generator.
supercite.el (3.54)   -- Supercite.
sc-oloads.el (3.10)   -- Overloading for old Emacsen.
sc-unsupp.el (3.7)    -- Some unsupported noodlings.
supercite.texi (3.47) -- TeXinfo manual for Supercite.
README (3.11)         -- This file.

Note that regi.el and reporter.el have been released as separate packages.
You should already have reporter.el if you have c++-mode.el 2.353 or
later.  Check the version numbers on reporter.el and keep the newest copy.
The interface is the same so it will work in a backwards compatible way.

In addition, you may want to pickup filladapt.el or gin-mode, but I don't
provide them here.

If you want to run bare-bones, and you are using the latest versions of
all the supported environments, you only really need regi.el, reporter.el,
and supercite.el.


QUICK GUIDE TO GETTING CONNECTED:
=================================
For all of the latest versions of supported software (GNUS, RMAIL, and
RNEWS under FSFmacs 19.16 or later or Lemacs 19.8 or later, VM 5.34 or
later, and MH-E 4 or later), just do the following to start using
Supercite:

1. byte compile supercite.el, regi.el, and reporter.el.  You will get some
   warnings from the byte compiler which you can safely ignore.

2. add this to your .emacs file:

	(autoload 'sc-cite-original     "supercite" "Supercite 3.1" t)
	(autoload 'sc-submit-bug-report "supercite" "Supercite 3.1" t)
	(add-hook 'mail-citation-hook 'sc-cite-original)

That's it!  If you are running any older version of Emacs or MUA, please
consult the texinfo manual for details.  Every conceivable combination is
covered therein, but there are too many to outline here.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 3.0
=========================
New variable sc-cite-blank-lines-p.

Inconsistent naming of variable sc-mumble-string and sc-mail-mumble.
All instances were changed to sc-mumble.

Bug fixes, bug fixes, bug fixes!

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 2.3
=========================
This version of Supercite is compatible with FSFmacs 19's
transient-mark-mode and Lemacs' zmacs-active-regions.  You should no
longer need the sc-pre-hook hack for getting Supercite 2.3 working with
FSFmacs 19.  If you don't know what this means, ignore it.

Also note that with any of the latest Emacs 19's you DO NOT NEED
overloading anymore.  The major exception is for GNEWS.  You should
remove any references to sc-oloads.el.  You'll still need overloading
for most Emacs 18's and some older Emacs 19's.

Finally, note that the main file has changed to supercite.el.  For
version 2 it used to be sc.el.  You'll need to change any require's
you might have in your .emacs file.

There are lots of new options and variables; please check out the texinfo
manual for details.
