;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;;  This package supports several card decks, plus flexible drawing
;;;  routines which allow a programmer to work on the higher level of
;;;  a card game program with these routines supplying shuffling,
;;;  displays with color, and even conversion into net-packets for
;;;  multi-user games under etalk.
;;;  These extensions require the game-lib.el package from etalk.
