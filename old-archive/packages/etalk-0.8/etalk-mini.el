;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;;   With support from sformat, these routines supply parsing, and
;;;   minibuffer commands for selecting users based on a finger
;;;   listing.  This code could prove useful in other types of
;;;   programs, and should be considered for such tasks.  Please let
;;;   me know of any such intentions so that I might help.

;;; History
;;;
;;; eml 7/14/94
;;; changed etalk-untabulate-buffer and etalk-get-hosts to use 
;;; re-search-forward for speed.
;;;
;;; eml 7/17/94
;;; etalk-format now correctly handles the short/long tty case
;;; reguardless of type of input, and also the console case.
