--- Add a New Site to the big HyperActiveFTP List

First of all, thank you for your contribution.

Ok, you will asked 5 questions. Respond in full sentences, or phrases or
whatever you want. Return ends input (unfortunately).
1) Topic of the new site. Just enter what is in general interesting about this
ftp site.    
2) Files at the new site. Just enter what files are interesting at this site
3) Description of the files. If the files are not self-explanatory give a
brief rundown on the files or if there a readme available via ftp, tell me
that and I will create a hyper-button to link out to it.
4) Ange-ftp pathname. Just type in the ftp address after the @ sign. IP # is
preferred, but names of sites are fine. If you enter both that is fine too.

You will then be tossed into a mail buffer. Just hit C-c C-c or edit the
contents of what will be sent to me for addition to the big site list.
5) NOW. If you would also like this site to be automatically added to your
frequent file just hit y in response to the next question. Otherwise hit n.
