Emacs-server and send-emacs server-client package
-------------------------------------------------

The "emacs-server" program is started by emacs as a sub process, it
will listen for a connection on a socket port (inet or unix) and print
the incoming 'things' on stdout; emacs will receive the message and
process the incoming message.
	
With the program "se" (send-emacs) you can - e.g. from a shell - send
files and emacs lisp code to emacs.

So you can say:

mymachine> pwd
/etc
mymachine> se hosts
mymachine> 

- and emacs will make a (find-file "/etc/hosts")

or:

mymachine> pwd
/etc
mymachine> se -e '(message "Loading file hosts")' -a '(sleep-for 2)(message "OK")' hosts
mymachine>

- emacs will print the message "Loading file hosts" - reading the
file, sleep in 2 seconds and then print the message "OK".

The emacs-server.el is a piece of emacs-list code to handle start
(restart) of the emacs-server program and to take care of the
evaluations of the emacs lisp expressions.

The programs has been compiled and used on SunOS4.1.1 and the AIX 3.1
and 3.2


How to install
--------------

Simply type 'make' in the directory where you have unpacked the source
code.

You will get two programs: 'emacs-server' and 'se' copy them to a
place in your path (e.g. /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin).

Emacs-byte-compile the emacs-server.el file and place the two files
emacs-server.el and emacs-server.elc in your emacs-lisp directory.

Insert the following lines in your .emacs file:

(load-library "emacs-server")
(emacs-server)

- restart emacs .... and you are 'up and running' (hopefully!)


How to run with UNIX socket
---------------------------

If you would like to run the programs on unix socket instead of inet
socket you will have the following lines in your .emacs file:

(load-library "emacs-server")
(emacs-server "-fp/tmp/se-unix")

- and the 'se' program should be called like

mymachine> se -fp/tmp/se-unix <files>

(you can make an alias instead of writhing all that)

This way 'emacs-server' and 'se' will communicate on a unix domain
socket in file /tmp/se-unix 


Please enjoy!
