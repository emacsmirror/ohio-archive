;;; Commentary:

;; The purpose with this package is to let you write just a few
;; characters of words you've written earlier to be able to expand
;; them.
;;
;; To expand a word, just put the point right after the word and press
;; M-/ (dabbrev-expand) or M-C-/ (dabbrev-completion).
;;
;; There are powerful things in this package that aren't turned on by
;; default. I recommend you to do the following.
;;
;; Put the following 2 lines in your .emacs file:
;; (setq dabbrev-always-check-other-buffers t)
;; (setq dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp "\\sw\\|\\s_")
;;
;; Dabbrev will now search in all buffers with the same major mode for
;; your expansions. It will also search for complete symbols, the old
;; dabbrev package only looked half-heartedly for symbols.
;;
;; Check out the customizable variables below to learn about all the
;; features of this package.

;;; Hints and tips for major modes writers:

;; Recommended values		C/Lisp etc	text
;; dabbrev-case-fold-search	nil		t
;; dabbrev-case-replace		nil		t
;;
;; Set the variables you want special for your mode like this:
;; (set (make-local-variable 'dabbrev-case-replace) nil)
;; Then you don't interfer with other modes.
;;
;; If your mode handles buffers that refers to other buffers
;; (i.e. compilation-mode, gud-mode), then try to set
;; `dabbrev-select-buffers-function' or `dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'
;; to a function that point out those buffers.

;; Same goes for major-modes that are connected to other modes.  There
;; are for instance a number of mail-modes.  One for reading, one for
;; creating a new mail etc.  Maybe those should be connected.

;; Example for GNUS (when we write a reply, we want dabbrev to look in
;; the article for expansion):
;; (set (make-local-variable 'dabbrev-friend-buffer-function)
;;      (lambda (buffer)
;;         (save-excursion
;;           (set-buffer buffer)
;;           (memq major-mode '(news-reply-mode gnus-article-mode)))))

;;; Change Log
;;  5.1 8 Dec 1994
;;  	Now uses RCS version numbering for new-dabbrev.el version numbers.
;;  	Submitted this to LCD.
;;  4.5 1994-11-25
;;      `dabbrev-completion' now searches all buffers when given
;;      prefix arg 16.
;;      Added new variable; `dabbrev-check-rest-of-buffers'.
;;      Added kill-ring idea to "Future enhancements".
;;  4.4 1994-11-22
;;	Changed the copyright text.  Thanks [hymie].
;;	new-dabbrev now handles abbrevs that starts with symbol
;;	syntax. Thanks [burgett] for kicking me to do it.
;;	Now also handles `dabbrev-abbrev-skip-leading-regexp' better.
;;  4.3 1994-11-14
;;	Now only displays "Expansion found in <buffer>" when the
;;	expansion has been found in buffers that hasn't been examined
;;	yet. Thanks [kifer].
;;      Added a new variable; `dabbrev-search-these-buffers-only'.
;;      Fixed bug in mini-buffer completion. Thanks [kifer].
;;      Found a real time-waster when using `dabbrev-completion'.
;;      Thanks for the elp.el package Barry Warsaw!
;;	Found bug that made point move in other buffers.
;;      Now handles Lucid emacs define-key style.
;;      Thanks [jules].
;;      Now uses the `<symbol>' syntax in doc strings.
;;      Cosmetic bugs and syntactical bugs in documentation strings.
;;      Thanks [hawley].
;;  4.2 1994-03-04
;;      Now searches other buffers again. Thanks [ake].
;;  4.1 1994-02-22
;;      Introduced the new variables `dabbrev-case-fold-search' and
;;      `dabbrev-case-replace'.
;;      Introduced the new variable `dabbrev-select-buffers-function'.
;;      Introduced the new variable `dabbrev-abbrev-skip-leading-regexp'.
;;      Changed `dabbrev-always-check-other-buffers' to not buffer local.
;;      Thanks [kifer].
;;      Bug in `dabbrev-completion', x expanded to xxy instead of xy.
;;      Thanks [kifer].
;;      Added `dabbrev-submit-feedback' for better error-reporting.
;;      The hooks (`dabbrev-select-buffers-function' and
;;      `dabbrev-friend-buffer-function') are now not automatically
;;      buffer local.
;;      Now provides dabbrev too.
;;  3.2 1993-12-14
;;      Message for expansion found in buffer other than current.
;;	Minor bugs.
;;  3.1 1993-12-13
;;      Better comment for `dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp'.
;;  3.0 1993-12-09
;;      Freshed things up for the release.
;;      `dabbrev-completion' now doesn't have to use the minibuffer.
;;      Thanks [alon].
;;  2.0 1993-12-02 Lars Lindberg <lli@sypro.cap.se>
;;      Searches in other buffers for the expansion.
;;      Works also for the minibuffer.
;;      Added `dabbrev-completion'.
;;      More efficient code.
;;      Found minor bugs.
;;  1.0 converted to Emacs Lisp by Spencer Thomas.
;;      Thoroughly cleaned up by Richard Stallman.
;;  0.0
;;      DABBREVS - "Dynamic abbreviations" hack, originally written by
;;      Don Morrison for Twenex Emacs.  Converted to mlisp by Russ Fish.
;;      Supports the table feature to avoid hitting the same expansion on
;;      re-expand, and the search size limit variable.

;; Known bugs and limitations.
;; - Possible to do several levels of `dabbrev-completion' in the
;;   minibuffer.
;; - dabbrev-completion doesn't handle resetting the globals variables
;;   right.  It resets them after finding the abbrev.

;; Future enhancements
;;  - Check the tags-files? Like tags-complete?
;;  - Add the possibility of searching both forward and backward to
;;    the nearest expansion.
;;  - Check the kill-ring when everything else fails. (Maybe something
;;  for hippie-expand?). [Bng] <boris@cs.rochester.edu>

You can also set it to nil if you want old-style dabbrev searching
(the abbreviation is from point to previous word-start, the
search is for symbols).

For instance, if you are programming in Lisp, yes-or-no-p is a symbol,
while 'yes', 'or', 'no' and 'p' are considered words.  If you set this
variable to nil, then expanding yes-or-no- will look for a symbol
starting with or containing 'no-'.  If you set this variable to
\"\\\\sw\\\\|\\\\s_\" dabbrev will look for a symbol starting with
\"yes-or-no-\". Finally, if you set this variable to \"\\\\sw\", then an
error will be signalled, because \"-\" is not part of a word but if you
try to expand \"yes-or-no\", dabbrev will look for a word starting with
\"no\".

The recommended value is \"\\\\sw\\\\|\\\\s_\".")

considered.  If still no suitable word is found, then look in the
buffers accepted by the function pointed out by variable
`dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'.

no argument is given, replace the previously-made expansion

The variable `dabbrev-backward-only' may be used to limit the
direction of search to backward if set non-nil.
