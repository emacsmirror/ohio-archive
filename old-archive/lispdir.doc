	       About the GNU Emacs Lisp Code Directory

                     Last Update: March 12 1993


Q. What *is* the Lisp Code Directory?

A. Originally it was simply a list, in tabular form, of various
packages of GNU Emacs Lisp code that had been posted to one of the
Emacs-related Internet or USENET mailing lists or newsgroups.  Later
it became a flat-file database and associated formatting software.
Today it includes over 800 entries, contains entries for the packages
in the standard GNU Emacs distribution, and there is an Emacs Lisp package
available for use with interfacing with it.

Q. Where can I get a copy of the Directory?

A. The latest copy can be ftp'd from archive.cis.ohio-state.edu.  The file
is pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/LCD-datafile.Z.  (The .Z means it's
compressed; use `binary' mode in ftp when retrieving it.)

Q. How can I get a copy of a package listed in the Directory?

A. The `archive' field of the LCD entry for the package indicates
where it's archived.  If this field starts with a `~', as in
~/lispdir.el.Z, the archive host is archive.cis.ohio-state.edu, and the
file is under the Emacs Lisp Archives which reside in the directory
pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive (see README.Z for more details).  If the
`archive' field is empty, the `contact' field indicates where one can
write by e-mail to obtain the code.  In the case of a package that's
part of the standard Emacs distribution, you probably already have it
in your $EMACS/lisp directory.  If you're  unable to find a copy
through the listed contact, post a query to gnu.emacs, info-gnu-emacs,
or your favorite Emacs group.

Q. What and where is the LCD interfacing package?

A. It's called `lispdir', and it's in ~/lispdir.el.Z.  (See previous
answer for details on exactly where that is.)  It currently produces a
full-directory report in three different formats, two of which are
tabular.  It also provides a function called lisp-dir-apropos that
pops up a buffer containing entries that relate to a given topic.

Q. I don't have ftp or uucp access.  Is there a mail archive server?

A. No, there isn't.  Probably the best thing for you to do is contact
the author directly or try to uses one of the mail/ftp gateway services.
If that fails, request the items you want via your favorite Emacs mailing
list or newsgroup.  We would like to set up a mail archive server, but
have our hands full keeping the archive up-to-date.  We would be very
interested in hearing from anyone who has experience in that area.

Q. How can I get my package added to the Directory or get typos or
inaccuracies fixed?

A. Dave Sill (de5@ornl.gov) and Dave Brennan (brennan@gnu.ai.mit.edu)
maintain the archive and the Directory.  Send typos, inaccuracies,
and submissions to them at the address elisp-archive@cis.ohio-state.edu.
See the GUIDELINES file for more information on submissions.
