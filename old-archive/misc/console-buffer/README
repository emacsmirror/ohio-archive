console-buffer REL1 - ben@piglet.cr.usgs.gov

This package makes an emacs buffer that contains a record of console
output. This can be handy for system administrators and the merely
curious.

It has been tested under Ultrix and DG/UX. It probably works under
other UNIXen. If you can make it work under something it doesn't
currently work on, please send me your changes, and I will
integrate them in the next release.

Since this code was developed on US Govt. equipment, it is in the
public domain, the authors hold no copyright on the code. If this
code makes your computer blow up, or causes damage in any other
way, it's not our fault; the program has no warranty.

The canonical place to get this program is 
brrcrftp.cr.usgs.gov:/pub/ben/console-buffer.tar.gz . Anonymous ftp or
fsp port 21 is supported.
