;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; For those who are annoyed by the mouse pointer obscuring text,
;;; this mode moves the mouse pointer - either just a little out of
;;; the way, or all the way to the corner of the frame. 
;;; To use, load or evaluate this file and type M-x mouse-avoidance-mode .
;;; To set up permanently, put this file on your load-path and put the
;;; following in your .emacs: 
;;;
;;; (cond (window-system
;;;        (require 'avoid)
;;;        (mouse-avoidance-mode 'cat-and-mouse)))
;;;
;;; The 'animate can be 'jump or 'banish or 'protean if you prefer.
;;;
;;; For added silliness, make the animatee animate...
;;; put something similar to the following into your .emacs:
;;;
;;; (cond (window-system
;;;       (setq x-pointer-shape 
;;;	     (eval (nth (random 4)
;;;			'(x-pointer-man x-pointer-spider
;;;			  x-pointer-gobbler x-pointer-gumby))))
;;;       (set-mouse-color (cdr (assoc 'mouse-color (frame-parameters))))))
;;;
;;; For completely random pointer shape, replace the setq above with:
;;; (setq x-pointer-shape (mouse-avoidance-random-shape))
;;; 
;;; Bugs & Warnings:
;;;
;;; - THIS CODE IS FOR USE WITH FSF EMACS 19.21 or later.
;;;   It can cause earlier versions of emacs to crash, due to a bug in the
;;;   mouse code. 
;;;
;;; - Using this code does slow emacs down.  "banish" mode shouldn't
;;;   ever be too bad though, and on my workstation even "animate" doesn't
;;;   seem to have a noticable effect.
;;;
;;; - There are some situations where it doesn't do what you expect,
;;;   notably when there are long wrapped lines in the buffer.  Since
;;;   there is no low-level command for finding point's position
;;;   on the screen, it can fail to move the pointer when on such a line.
