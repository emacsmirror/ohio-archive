;;; Commentary:

;;; The docstring for the function `type-break-mode' summarizes most of the
;;; details of the interface.

;;; This package relies on the assumption that you live entirely in emacs,
;;; as the author does.  If that's not the case for you (e.g. you often
;;; suspend emacs or work in other windows) then this won't help very much;
;;; it will depend on just how often you switch back to emacs.  At the very
;;; least, you will want to turn off the keystroke thresholds and rest
;;; interval tracking.

;;; This package was inspired by Roland McGrath's hanoi-break.el.
;;; Thanks to both Roland McGrath <roland@gnu.ai.mit.edu> and Mark Ashton
;;; <mpashton@gnu.ai.mit.edu> for feedback and ideas.

;;; Code:

;; will cause scheduling and so forth to happen.

the scheduled time has elapsed; the break is simply rescheduled until later
if the minimum threshold hasn't been reached.  If this first value is nil,
then there is no minimum threshold; as soon as the scheduled time has
elapsed, the user will always be queried.

The second number is the maximum number of keystrokes that can be entered
before a typing break is requested immediately, pre-empting the originally
scheduled break.  If this second value is nil, then no pre-emptive breaks
will occur; only scheduled ones will.

Keys with bucky bits (shift, control, meta, etc) are counted as only one

(defun type-break-mode (&optional prefix)
  "Enable or disable typing-break mode.
This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.

When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at
appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the
user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user
is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, emacs will ask
again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time
to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently
annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.

A negative prefix argument disables this mode.
No argument or any non-negative argument enables it.

The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the
same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or
reset the keystroke counter.

If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of
calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to
make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the
break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.

The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to
schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly
affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the
`type-break-schedule' command.

If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum
amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever
that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for
later even if emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break
is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether
or not to continue.

The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the
thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use
the command `type-break-guestimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to
approximate good values for this.

Finally, the command `type-break-statistics' prints interesting things."
