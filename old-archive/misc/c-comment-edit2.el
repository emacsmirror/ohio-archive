;;; Documentation:
;;
;;      Date: 12 Jan 89 17:36:19 GMT
;;
;;      Attached is an enhanced version of the `c-comment-edit' package, last
;;      posted sometime in 1987.
;;
;;      c-comment-edit is a command that copies a C comment into a
;;      temporary buffer for editing under a more suitable major mode
;;      (usually text-mode).  Once the comment is edited,
;;      c-comment-edit-end (normally bound to C-c ESC) replaces the old
;;      comment with the edited version, adding comment delimiters and
;;      leaders as necessary.  c-comment-edit is ideal for large comments
;;      of these styles:
;;
;;      /*      /*      /*
;;        ...    * ...  ** ...
;;        ...    * ...  ** ...
;;      */       */     */
;;
;;      Features added:
;;
;;      o c-comment-edit no longer uses a recursive-edit so multiple
;;        c-comment-edit's  be running simultaneously.
;;      o c-comment-edit will now search forward from point for a comment if
;;        point is not within a comment.
;;      o c-comment-edit-hook is provided.
;;      o Bill Carpenter's c-comment-leader-regexp fixed was incorporated.

;;; Change Log:
;; [jari]   = <jari.aalto@poboxes.com>
;;
;; Feb  26      1997    [jari]          19.28   v1.9            Released
;; - Small error in window configuration restore corrected.
;;
;; Dec  11      1996    [jari]          19.28   v1.6-1.8        Released
;; - Some minor byte compilation corrections. Window configuration
;;   bug corrected. c-comment-edit-at-point corrected in C++ mode.
;;
;; May  27      1996    [jari]          19.28   v1.5            Released
;; - Added saving/restoring the frame configuration. Previously the
;;   window layout was destroyed when the c-comment-edit-end was
;;   finished. Now windows are restored as they were.
;; - Made this package 18.xx compatible again.
;;
;; Apr  30      1996    [jari]          19.28   v1.4            Released
;; - Jerome Santini <santini@chambord.univ-orleans.fr> reported problems
;;   in 19.30 with the font-lock code. Now the eval-when-compile
;;   forms take in effect only if font-lock is not present. This was
;;   serious bug.
;; - Renamed all the rest functions to have prefix "c-comment". This
;;   follows the GNU package guidelines.
;; - Added defontifying a comment in separate buffer to get clear look.
;;
;; Oct  14      1995    [jari]          19.28   v1.3            Released
;; - Corrected the LCD entry, that was mistakenly modified.
;;
;; Sep  8       1995    [jari]          19.28   v1.2            NotReleased
;; - Cleaned up the Newsereader headers and presedved only 'date:'
;;   of original introduction
;;   within-c-comment-p         :!  renamed to comment-area, more general
;; - Added new function c-comment-edit-at-point.  If point is inside of a
;;   comment, the comment is edited.  Otherwise, a new comment is created
;;   at point. [jcolman]
;; - Cleared byte-compiler errors. Added optional parameters to main function
;;   c-comment-edit. Main also now returns more gracefully, if comment
;;   syntax isn't defined. This really should be made more general..
;;
;; Sep  4       1995    [jari]          19.28   v1.1            NotReleased
;; - Jake Colman <jcolman@j51.com> sent mail asking to crrect some
;;   things. Great that I get user feedback!
;; - kill-all-local-variables call removed
;; - renamed  c-comment-edit-after-hook --> c-comment-edit-exit-hook
;;   and moved it to the end of defun.
;; - The fill-column setting has been adjusted to include "/*" (-2 from the
;;   original setting).
;; - When edited comment is inserted back, the colors are gone. This has been
;;   corrected to re-fontify the comment if font-lock-mode is on.
;; - Added c-comment-edit-load-hook
;;
;; Apr  28      1995    [jari]          19.28   v0.2            NotReleased
;; - After talking with Kyle directly, he said that I should load
;;   this .el  with some other name, because he didn't plan to have
;;   any enhancement support. He said that I had been among the very
;;   few that had ever asked any changes to this module.
;; - On my behalf, since this is almost identical copy of the
;;   original, I have no objections that someone else modifies this
;;   .el with the "c-comment-edit2.el" -- I do plan to update this if it has
;;   errors that are caused by me of course, but right now I don't
;;   think it misses anything crucial. Just drop me a note, I love to hear
;;   about new improvements.
;;
;; Feb  22      1995    [jari]          19.28   v0.1            NotReleased
;; - I had used this intensively when 18.57 was still around in our
;;   envinronment (about 4 moths ago), but when I moved to 19.28
;;   I found some incompatibilities in keybindings and I dislike the
;;   comment syntax which left first line empty. Now there is variable
;;   to configure 1st line layout.
;; - Now ESC ESC terminates in 19 and ESC in 18.
;; - Added few confortable variables
;;   *  c-comment-edit-bname , c-comment-edit-empty-1-line
;;   *  c-comment-edit-other-buffer , c-comment-edit-C-buf
;;   *  c-comment-edit-[bc,ec]
;; - Added hooks
;;   *  c-comment-edit-end-hook
;;   *  c-comment-edit-after-hook
;;
;; - touched original code:
;;   *  c-comment-edit
;;      - there was one problem with this, the hook was too early
;;        run compared to kill-local-var, so if you turned on some minor
;;        mode, it was effectively lost. --> now the hook runs last.
;;   *  c-comment-edit-end
;;      - Added the new functionality here, many changes, sets global
;;        variables + runs hooks
;;
;; - There is an EXAMPLE section at the end of this file which is one of
;;   my favourite C/C++ function header. And cleanup function to
;;   retain the format after comment has been added too.

(defun c-comment-edit (&optional search-prefix com-start com-end)
  "Edit multi-line C comments.
This command allows the easy editing of a multi-line C comment like this:
   /*
    * ...
    * ...
    */
The comment may be indented or flush with the left margin.

If point is within a comment, that comment is used.  Otherwise the
comment to be edited is found by searching forward from point.

With one \\[universal-argument] searching starts after moving back one
  paragraph.
With two \\[universal-argument]'s searching starts at the beginning of the
  current or proceeding C function.
With three \\[universal-argument]'s searching starts at the beginning of the
  current page.
With four \\[universal-argument]'s searching starts at the beginning of the
  current buffer (clipping restrictions apply).

Once located, the comment is copied into a temporary buffer, the comment
leaders and delimiters are stripped away and the resulting buffer is
selected for editing.  The major mode of this buffer is controlled by
the variable `c-comment-edit-mode'.

Use \\[c-comment-edit-end] when you have finished editing the comment.  The
comment will be inserted into the original buffer with the appropriate
delimiters and indention, replacing the old version of the comment.  If
you don't want your edited version of the comment to replace the
original, use \\[c-comment-edit-abort]."

;;{{{ Example
;;; ......................................................... &example ...

;; - Here is ready setup, which you could use right away.
;; - I am used to program all my C/C++ function like this, where the
;;   header is just before each function:
;;
;; /*************************************************************************
;;  * <PUBLIC> FUNCTION: MyFunc
;;  *************************************************************************
;;  * DESCRIPTION
;;  * - This is function is the main entry point to class myClass.
;;  *   it handles reading the oracle database....
;;  *
;;  * SPECIAL
;;  * - Note, that the oracle connection must be verified before your're
;;  *   using this function....
;;  *
;;  * RETURNS
;;  * - Creates object errorAtom which hold data about the promlem occurred.
;;  *   other
;;  *************************************************************************/
;; errorAtom_c *myClass_c::Execute(char * ptr)
;; {
;;
;; }
;;
;;
;; - In order to maintain the '*****' breaks correctly you have to use some
;;   cleanup function like one below. It detects if the Comment has
;;   '****' in it and does nothing if it's regular comment.
;;
;; - Remember that when the comment has been edited, the comment style you
;;   choosed, affects the function. This supposes you have use the 'one star'
;;   style.
;; - Code can be easily extracted with function tinylib.el/ti::m-pkg-rip-magic
