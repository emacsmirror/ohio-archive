;;; Modification history:
;;; 02/28/95	Some documentation changes.
;;; 02/24/95	Added auto-show-show-left-margin-threshold so that if
;;;		there is anyway for the left margin to be displayed it is.
;;; 02/24/95	Only scroll window if it matches current buffer.  Added
;;;		function for enabeling scrolling in comint buffers on output.
;;; 02/13/95	Aded Kevin Broadey <KevinB@bartley.demon.co.uk> fix so that
;;;		it doesn't scroll if we are at window border and at the
;;;		end of the line (i.e. newline character)
;;; 02/10/95	jeff.dwork@amd.com added auto-show-toggle function.
;;; 02/08/95	Added auto-show-enable as per
;;;		jeff.dwork@amd.com (Jeff Dwork)'s suggestion.  Cleaned up
;;;		documentation.
;;; 02/07/95	Rewrote for emacs 19: much, much cleaner.  Renamed auto-show
;;; 8/6/90	Make next-line/previous-line do better job following movement.
;;; 3/21/90         better calculation of w-width in e-make-point-visible
;;;                 test for truncated windows
;;;                 added substitute-in-keymap
;;;                 renamed to auto-horizontal
;;;                 added backward-delete-char
;;; 8/13/88	Created

;;;
;;; This is a rewrite of auto-horizontal.  It is comparable in
;;; functionality to hscroll.el except it is not a minor mode.  This
;;; file provides functions that automatically scroll the window
;;; horizontally when the point moves off the left or right side of
;;; the window.  To load it just add:
;;;
;;; 	(require 'auto-show)
;;;
;;; to your .emacs.
;;;

;;; Setting the variable ``truncate-lines'' to non-nil causes long
;;; lines to disappear off the end of the screen instead of wrapping
;;; to the beginning of the next line.  To make this the default for
;;; all buffers add the following line to your .emacs (sans ;;;):
;;;
;;; 	(set-default 'truncate-lines t)
;;;

;;; However, I've found that I only want this when I'm editing C code.
;;; Accordingly I have something like the following in my .emacs:
;;;
;;; (set-default 'truncate-lines nil)	; this is the original value
;;; (defun my-c-mode-hook ()
;;;   "Run when C-mode starts up.  Changes ..."
;;;   ... set various personal preferences ...
;;;   (setq truncate-lines t))
;;; (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
;;;
;;;
;;; As a finer level of control, one can still have truncated lines but
;;; without the automatic left and right scrolling by setting the buffer
;;; local variable ``auto-show-enable'' to nil.  The default value is t.
;;; The command ``auto-show-toggle'' will toggle the value of
;;; ``auto-show-enable''.
;;;
;;;
;;; I also like the output from my shell's (and other comint.el based commands)
;;; to scroll on output.  One can call:
;;;
;;;	(auto-show-comint-make-point-visible)
;;;
;;; which adds auto-show-make-point-visible to comint-output-filter-functions.
