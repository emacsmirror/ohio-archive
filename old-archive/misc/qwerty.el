; This trivial piece of Emacs Lisp was inspired by Stephen Jay Gould's
; essay "The Panda's Thumb of Technology" in his book "Bully for
; Brontosaurus".  In this essay, he explains how the intrinsically
; inefficient QWERTY keyboard layout (all the most common keys are in
; weak finger positions) is a hangover from the days when typists
; needed to be slowed down so that the (hidden) mechanics of the
; typewriter didn't get jammed.  Maybe if enough people come to use
; Emacs and realise the advantages of different keyboard layouts, the
; days of QWERTY could be numbered.

; EXAMPLE: French keyboards often have A and Q swapped around
; (in comparison with English keyboards).  So a French person
; unused to the English layout (and vice-versa) could re-program
; his/her keyboard by typing `M-x anti-qwerty RET aq RET qa RET'.

; I would be very interested to hear about alternative keyboard
; layouts that anyone may use, preferably with their definitions
; with respect to the usual QWERTY layout.

  "Remaps the keyboard according to OLD and NEW strings.  OLD should
include all the keys that the user wants to change, typed in the
default keyboard system (usually qwerty).  NEW is what the user would
like to be typing in order to produce the contents of OLD on the
screen.

  The third (optional prefix) argument CTRL, if non-nil, means that
any transformations on letters that occur should be duplicated in the
related control characters: in other words, if `a' becomes `z', then
`C-a' should become `C-z'.

  Before implementing any changes the function first checks that the
mapping implied by OLD and NEW is one to one, in other words no two
keyboard keys may map to the same character and a single keyboard key
may not be given two different mappings.  If any such errors are
discovered in the mapping, no changes to the keyboard are made.

  As an additional safeguard, this function binds the keystroke `M-\'
to the restoring function `qwerty'.  If the fourth (optional) argument
UNSAFE is non-nil, this binding is suppressed."
