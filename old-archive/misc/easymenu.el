(defmacro easy-menu-define (symbol maps doc menu)
  "Define a menu bar submenu in maps MAPS, according to MENU.
The arguments SYMBOL and DOC are ignored; they are present for
compatibility only.  SYMBOL is not evaluated.  In other Emacs versions
these arguments may be used as a variable to hold the menu data, and a
doc string for that variable.

The first element of MENU must be a string.  It is the menu bar item name.
The rest of the elements are menu items.

A menu item is usually a vector of three elements:  [NAME CALLBACK ENABLE]

NAME is a string--the menu item name.

CALLBACK is a command to run when the item is chosen,
or a list to evaluate when the item is chosen.

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

Alternatively, a menu item may have the form: 

   [ NAME CALLBACK [ KEYWORD ARG ] ... ]

Where KEYWORD is one of the symbol defined below.

   :keys KEYS

KEYS is a string; a complex keyboard equivalent to this menu item.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

   :suffix NAME

NAME is a string; the name of an argument to CALLBACK.

   :style 
   
STYLE is a symbol describing the type of menu item.  The following are
defined:  

toggle: A checkbox.  
        Currently just prepend the name with the string \"Toggle \".
radio: A radio button. 
nil: An ordinary menu item.

   :selected SELECTED

SELECTED is an expression; the checkbox or radio button is selected
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.
Currently just disable radio buttons, no effect on checkboxes.

A menu item can be a string.  Then that string appears in the menu as
unselectable text.  A string consisting solely of hyphens is displayed
as a solid horizontal line.

A menu item can be a list.  It is treated as a submenu.
The first element should be the submenu name.  That's used as the
menu item in the top-level menu.  The cdr of the submenu list
is a list of menu items, as above."
