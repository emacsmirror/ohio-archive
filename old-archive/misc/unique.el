;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;; 
;; This package provides functions to uniquify lists, and commands to uniquify
;; buffer text.

;; Provided are uniquification functions `unique' and `uniq'.  Their
;; differences and relative performances are described below.
;;
;; The function `unique' takes the list to be uniquified and a destructor
;; function as args.  This function takes an element and list as args.  It
;; returns the list minus occurrences of the element.  This destructor function
;; is called for each item in the list to be uniquified, with the rest of the
;; list, and `unique' is therefore polynomial (as a function of the square of
;; the length of the list, i.e., it is quadratic) iff the destructor function
;; never removes any items from the list.
;;
;; The function `uniq' takes the list to be uniquified and a comparator
;; function as args.  This function takes two elements.  It returns non-nil if
;; the two elements are equivalent, the latter duplicate is removed.  This
;; comparator function is called for each item in the list to be uniquified,
;; except the last, and `uniq' is therefore polynomial (as a function of the
;; length of the list, i.e., it is linear) iff the comparator function never
;; returns non-nil (no items are removed from the list).
;;
;; For example, the uniquification function `unique':
;;
;; (unique '("a" "b" "b" "b" "c" "d" "d" "e") 'delete)
;;      => ("a" "b" "c" "d" "e")
;;
;; Note that non-adjacent duplicate items are removed too:
;;
;; (unique '("foo" "bar" "is" "fubar" "as" "well" "as" "foo" "bar") 'delete)
;;      => ("foo" "bar" "is" "fubar" "as" "well")
;;
;; If you want to remove all but the last duplicate, reverse the list before
;; and after uniquification:
;;
;; (let ((list '("foo" "bar" "is" "fubar" "as" "well" "as" "foo" "bar")))
;;   (nreverse (unique (nreverse list) 'delete)))
;;      => ("is" "fubar" "well" "as" "foo" "bar")
;;
;; However, the uniquification function `uniq' only removes adjacent duplicate
;; items, like the Un*x command "uniq":
;;
;; (uniq '("foo" "bar" "is" "fubar" "as" "well" "as" "foo" "bar")
;;       'string-equal)
;;      => ("foo" "bar" "is" "fubar" "as" "well" "as" "foo" "bar")
;;
;; To work on non-adjacent duplicate items, you must sort the list first.
;; However, using `sort' changes the order of the list and is relatively slow:
;;
;; (let ((list '("foo" "bar" "is" "fubar" "as" "well" "as" "foo" "bar")))
;;   (uniq (sort list 'string-lessp) 'string-equal))
;;      => ("as" "bar" "foo" "fubar" "is" "well")
;;
;; So why is it provided?  Good question.  If the list is already sorted, and
;; most items are unique anyway, `uniq' is quicker than `unique'.  See below.
;;
;; With strings:
;;
;; For example, running these functions on the list of one-character strings
;; built from the file .../lisp/comint.el (89146 strings, 98 (0.11%) unique):
;;
;; `uniq'	6.0 s	(pre-sorted)	0.008 s (pre-uniqed pre-sorted)
;; `unique'	11.4 s			0.047 s	(pre-uniqued)
;; `sort'	43.8 s			0.013 s (pre-uniqed pre-sorted)
;;					0.017 s	(pre-uniqued)
;; Speedup:	1.9x	(0.23x incl. `sort')
;;
;; For example, running these functions on the list of word strings built from
;; the file .../lisp/comint.el (12727 words, 2034 (16.0%) unique):
;; 
;; `uniq'	0.78 s	(pre-sorted)	0.14 s (pre-uniqed pre-sorted)
;; `unique'	58.8 s			15.9 s	(pre-uniqued)
;; `sort'	4.80 s			0.440 s (pre-uniqed pre-sorted)
;;					0.638 s	(pre-uniqued)
;; Speedup:	75x	(10x incl. `sort')
;;
;; For example, running these functions on the list of lines built from
;; the file .../lisp/comint.el (2073 lines, 1736 (83.7%) unique):
;; 
;; `uniq'	0.14 s	(pre-sorted)	0.12 s (pre-uniqed pre-sorted)
;; `unique'	10.8 s			10.6 s	(pre-uniqued)
;; `sort'	0.65 s			0.356 s (pre-uniqed pre-sorted)
;;					0.509 s	(pre-uniqued)
;; Speedup:	77x	(14x incl. `sort')
;;
;; With numbers:
;;
;; For example, running these functions on a list of 1024 random integers in
;; the interval [0, 102400) (typically 99.5% unique):
;; 
;; `uniq'	0.066 s	(pre-sorted)
;; `unique'	0.841 s
;; `sort'	0.277 s
;; Speedup:	12.7x	(2.45x incl. `sort')
;;
;; For example, running these functions on a list of 5120 random integers in
;; the interval [0, 512000) (typically 99.5% unique):
;; 
;; `uniq'	0.336 s	(pre-sorted)
;; `unique'	18.85 s
;; `sort'	1.707 s
;; Speedup:	56x	(9.23x incl. `sort')
;;
;; For example, running these functions on a list of 10240 random integers in
;; the interval [0, 1024000) (typically 99.5% unique):
;; 
;; `uniq'	0.671 s	(pre-sorted)
;; `unique'	73.88 s
;; `sort'	3.759 s
;; Speedup:	110x	(16.7x incl. `sort')
;;
;; Note how `uniq' runs in approximately linear time w.r.t. the length of the
;; list (and `sort' is almost linear---probably n*log2(n)---see a book),
;; whereas `unique' runs in approximately polynomial (square) time.  Double the
;; length of the list, quadruple the evaluation time.  Therefore, if the list
;; is almost entirely unique, the speedup of `uniq' (sorting excluded) over
;; `unique' is almost the same as the increase in list size.
;;
;; From the above, we can see that rather than deciding when you should use
;; `uniq' rather than `unique' it is the other way around (wibble).  If (1) you
;; care about list order and/or (2) you know that hardly any items are unique,
;; then you should use `unique'.  Otherwise, use `uniq' and `sort'.

;; Provided are uniquification commands:
;;
;; `unique-lines' for the removal of duplicate lines, `unique-words' for words
;; and `unique-sentences' for sentences.  They can be invoked as extended
;; commands or bound to keys:
;;
;; M-x unique-lines
;;
;; (local-set-key "\C-cl" 'unique-lines)
;;
;; Typing C-c l invokes `unique-lines' on the currently selected region.

;; Installation:
;; 
;; To use, put in your package that uses these functions:
;;
;; (require 'unique)
;;
;; or autoload in your ~/.emacs the specific functions you require:
;;
;; (autoload 'unique "unique"
;;   "Uniquify LIST, deleting elements using PREDICATE.")
;; (autoload 'uniq "unique"
;;   "Uniquify LIST, comparing adjacent elements using PREDICATE.")
;;
;; (autoload 'unique-lines "unique" "Uniquify lines in region." t)
;; (autoload 'unique-words "unique" "Uniquify words in region." t)
;; (autoload 'unique-sentences "unique" "Uniquify sentences in region." t)

(defun unique-subr (nextrecfun endrecfun &optional startkeyfun endkeyfun)
  "General text unique routine to divide buffer into records and uniquify them.
Arguments are NEXTRECFUN ENDRECFUN and optional STARTKEYFUN ENDKEYFUN.

We divide the accessible portion of the buffer into disjoint pieces called
unique records (they are the same as sort records).  A portion of each unique
record (perhaps all of it) is designated as the unique key.  The records are
rearranged in the buffer by their unique keys.  The records may or may not be
contiguous.

The four arguments are functions to be called to move point across a unique
record.  They will be called many times from within unique-subr.

NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.  It moves
point to the start of the next record.  It should move point to the end of the
buffer if there are no more records.  The first record is assumed to start at
the position of point when unique-subr is called.

ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.  It should move point to the
end of the record.

STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.  It may
return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or else the key is the
substring between the values of point after STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are
called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key starts at the beginning of the record.

ENDKEYFUN moves from the start of the unique key to the end of the unique key.
ENDKEYFUN may be nil if STARTKEYFUN returns a value or if it would be the
same as ENDRECFUN."
