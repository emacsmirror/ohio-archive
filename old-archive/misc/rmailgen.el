;;; Commentary:

;;; This package generates guesses for RMAIL output files when `o'
;;; (`rmail-output-to-rmail-file') is hit in RMAIL.  When replying to mail
;;; messages (`r') it will generate archive file names (i.e., the FCC, file
;;; carbon-copy, file names that appear in *mail* buffers) if
;;; `rmailgen-archive-file-name' is non-nil (the default).  Both of
;;; these are done using the header of the current RMAIL message.  See Example
;;; Installation below.
;;;
;;; This package also allows user to set a default RMAIL mail directory, see
;;; `rmailgen-default-directory'.
;;;
;;; Specifically, this package parses the account names in the "From:" and
;;; "To:" lines of the original RMAIL message.  It does this by placing a lisp
;;; expression in `rmail-output-file-alist'.  The expression-driven form of
;;; `rmail-output-file-alist' requires GNU Emacs version 19.17 or later.
;;;
;;; Note that `C-o' (`rmail-output'), used for Un*x output format, does not
;;; use `rmail-output-file-alist' so in that case no name is automatically
;;; generated.  However, `o' (`rmail-output-to-rmail-file') is smart enough to
;;; distinguish between Un*x and BABYL format in pre-existing folders.
;;; Therefore, there is really no need to use C-o for appending to a
;;; pre-existing folder (`C-o' is still very useful for outputing a message in
;;; plain Un*x format -- in case you don't want a BABYL header stuck on it).

;;; Bugs:
;;;
;;; If you encounter a bug in this code, wish to suggest an enhancement, or
;;; want to make a smart remark, then type
;;;
;;;              M-x rmailgen-submit-report
;;;
;;; This will set up an outgoing mail buffer, with the proper address to the
;;; `rmailgen.el' maintainer automatically inserted in the `To:' field.  This
;;; command also inserts information that the maintainer can use to recreate
;;; your exact setup, making it easier to verify your bug or social
;;; maladjustment.

Here is revision 2.1 of rmailgen.el.  Read the "Commentary:" section
to find out what it does.  The names of all variables have been
changed to start with the prefix `rmailgen-'; the old prefix
`rmail-generate-' was too long and there was a danger of confusing
it with rmail variables.  

A zeroth-order installation would be `M-x load-library rmailgen'.
Read "Installation:" for more elaborate installations.

;;; ;; 4. By default, rmailgen.el downcases generated filenames

;;;; SECTION B.
;;;; Generate a guess for `rmail-output-to-rmail-file' ("o" in RMAIL).

;;; Algorithm:
;;;
;;; 1. What ../lisp/rmailout.el of GNU Emacs 19 does:
;;;
;;;    Each element of the variable `rmail-output-file-alist' is of the form
;;;    (REGEXP . NAME-EXP).  `rmail-output-to-rmail-file' searches the current
;;;    RMAIL message for REGEXP.  If found it then evaluates the NAME-EXP
;;;    although it may just be a plain string.  If no match is found then the
;;;    name of the last output file is used.
;;;
;;; 2. What this file does:
;;;
;;;    REGEXP is defined so it will locate the login-name of the sender of the
;;;    current message by looking in the "From" field and then the "To" field.
;;;    NAME-EXP is the function `rmailgen-output-name' which extracts this
;;;    name.  The sender's login-name is returned as a lower-case string as
;;;    long as it does not match the user's own login-name, otherwise it
;;;    returns nil so `rmail-output-to-rmail-file' will continue to search the
;;;    alist.

;;; Define `rmail-output-file-alist' if not already.  That is, maybe
;;; ../lisp/rmailout.el has not been loaded yet and user has not defined any
;;; values.  The value and the doc-string will both be overwritten when
;;; necessary this just prevents an error message when we try to `append' to
;;; this variable.
