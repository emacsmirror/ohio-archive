;;; automatically create file names based on email addresses for rmail|
;;; 31-Jan-1994|1.01|~/misc/rmail-saver.el.el.Z|
;;;
;;; Purpose of this package:
;;;
;;; This package does 2 things. It:
;;; 
;;; 1) parses your current message for a From: or Sender: line and
;;; intelligently creates a file name according to your specifications,
;;; i.e. it will save mail from andy@some.regular.path to a file
;;; called andy or a file called andy@some or a file called
;;; andy@some.regular or a file called andy@some.regular.path in a
;;; directory that you specify.
;;;
;;; It will save in either rmail or regular mail (inbox) format.
;;;
;;; The address parser also understands uucp style bang paths and
;;; converts them to internet style paths when creating the file name.
;;; 
;;; 2) Includes functions to do this for all the undeleted messages in your
;;; RMAIL file and then will mark them for deletion.
;;; 
;;; To save the current message in a file, use
;;; M-x daves-rmail-save-this-message-babyl
;;; or
;;; M-x daves-rmail-save-this-message-inbox
;;; 
;;; which parses the message, then saves into either babyl (RMAIL) or
;;; inbox (regular mail) files in the directory saved-rmail-file-directory.
;;; 
;;; To save all files that are currently not marked for deletion, use
;;; M-x daves-rmail-save-messages-babyl
;;; or
;;; M-x daves-rmail-save-messages-inbox
;;;
;;; The files are saved under the directory saved-rmail-file-directory. 
;;; the default for this is ~/RMail/
;;;
;;; Now some more details to allow you to screw around with the
;;; filename creation scheme. There are 3 user-defined variables that
;;; control the 3 levels of filename length and content checking. They are:
;;; user-machine-domain-and-company-length (default value 15)
;;; user-machine-and-domain-length (default value 12) 
;;; user-and-machine-type-address-length (default value 7) 
;;;
;;; First of all, by making any of these variables nil, only the user
;;; name (the first part of the address) is returned as the file name.   
;;;
;;; Each is the maximum length of an incoming address part - These
;;; variables define where to truncate the mail address when making a
;;; file name. For addresses of the type "user@machine.domain.company"
;;; or longer, only the first 3 names are looked at (up to the company
;;; field). I'm no RFC 822 pro so I just called them user, machine,
;;; domain, and company. If someone's got good info on this, I'd be
;;; glad to change the names to the correct ones.
;;;
;;; user-machine-domain-and-company-length deals with addresses of the
;;; type "user@machine.domain.company". If the address is shorter than
;;; this length, then that address is returned as the file name.
;;; Otherwise, the other two levels of checking are done. To
;;; disable this level of checking but keep the other two, set
;;; user-machine-domain-and-company-length to 0.
;;;
;;; user-machine-and-domain-length deals with addresses of the
;;; type "user@machine.domain". If the address is shorter than this
;;; length, then the address is returned as the file name. Otherwise
;;; the last level of checking is done. To disable this level of
;;; checking but to keep the other two, set
;;; user-machine-and-domain-length to 0.
;;;
;;; user-and-machine-type-address-length deals with addresses of the
;;; type "user@machine". If the address is shorter than this length,
;;; then the address is returned as the file name. If the length of
;;; the address is greater than user-and-machine-type-address-length
;;; then the default file name, the user name is returned.
;;;
;;; If the mail is local (of the type "user") then it is made the file
;;; name. 
;;;
;;; If the variable daves-rmail-prompt-for-filename is non-nil, the
;;; functions in rmail-saver will give you a prompt allowing you to
;;; enter your own filename when saving, and the parsed filename
;;; becomes the default. If nil, rmail-saver works quietly, using only
;;; the parsed filenames when saving. 
;;;
;;;
;;; There are 2 hooks: daves-rmail-before-save-message-hook and
;;; daves-rmail-after-save-message-hook which are called before and
;;; after messages are saved, respectively. These hooks are only run
;;; for daves-rmail-save-messages-babyl and
;;; daves-rmail-save-messages-inbox calls. 
;;;
;;; Since this package makes use of mail-extract-address-components from
;;; mail-extr.el, that package is needed. It is packaged as part of
;;; the 19.19 distribution.
;;;
;;; I'm always looking for improvements, suggestions, bug reports,
;;; criticisms, etc of the code. If you have a patch, please send it
;;; to me and I'll incorporate it into the next version. This is my
;;; first major piece of lisp code that I'm putting out to the net, so
;;; be warned, and be gentle. I consider this beta code - It works on
;;; my setup of emacs, but there may be problems on other setups.
;;; 
;;;
;;; To Do: Set it up to save only messages marked with a certain tag
;;;        or via a regexp. Clean up the code, especially the parser.
;;;        Set up the Classify menu so that the original menu options
;;;        are at the top, and the new options are on the bottom.
;;;        Maybe someone with lots of keymap experience can fix this?
;;;
;;; Known bugs:
;;; Bugs: It has some problems with mail headers using % - my bug fix
;;; just changes all of the % in the headers to . after the parsing is
;;; done. This does not affect the parsing routine. Anyone know of a
;;; better way to do this to maintain the % ? Emacs thinks that it is
;;; part of a format command.
;;;
;;;
;;; Installation instructions:
;;; To use:
;;;
;;; You'll need to either create a directory called RMail in your home
;;; directory (note the capitalizations) or change the variable
;;; saved-rmail-file-directory to the directory you want messages
;;; saved to.
;;; 
;;; Usage instructions:
;;; Add this to your .emacs file:
;;; (autoload 'daves-rmail-save-messages-babyl "rmail-saver" nil t)
;;; (autoload 'daves-rmail-save-messages-inbox "rmail-saver" nil t)
;;; (autoload 'daves-rmail-save-this-message-babyl "rmail-saver" nil t)
;;; (autoload 'daves-rmail-save-this-message-inbox "rmail-saver" nil t)
;;;
;;; If you want rmail-saver to prompt you each time it saves a message, put
;;; this in your .emacs: 
;;; (setq daves-rmail-prompt-for-filename t)
;;;
;;; If you want to bind these functions to key mappings and menu bar items in 
;;; RMAIL and RMAIL-summary modes, I use:
;;;
;;; (setq rmail-mode-hook
;;;       '(lambda ()
;;; 	 (define-key rmail-mode-map "\C-co" 
;;; 	   'daves-rmail-save-this-message-babyl)
