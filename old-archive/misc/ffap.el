;;; Description:
;;
;; Command find-file-at-point (== ffap) replaces find-file.  With a
;; prefix, it behaves exactly like find-file.  Without a prefix, it
;; first tries to guess a default file or URL based on the text around
;; the point (set `ffap-require-prefix' to swap these behaviors).
;; This is a quick way to fetch URL and file references in many
;; situations, such as in mail or news messages, README's, and
;; MANIFEST's.
;;
;; Some related commands are ffap-at-mouse, ffap-next, ffap-menu,
;; ffap-other-window, ffap-other-frame.
;;
;; This package is about user convenience.  It adds nothing to the
;; elisp programmer's repertoire.


;;; Installation:

;; Quick Setup:
;;
;; For a basic installation, just install ffap.el somewhere in your
;; `load-path', byte-compile it, and add the following two lines near
;; the end of your ~/.emacs (or equivalent) file:
;;
;; (require 'ffap)                      ; load this file
;; (global-set-key "\C-x\C-f" 'find-file-at-point)
;;
;; Other Packages: ffap notices the presence of several other packages
;; when it is loaded.  In particular, if you use ange-ftp, efs, w3,
;; complete, or ff-paths (version < 3.00), it is best to load or
;; autoload them before loading ffap (ffap does not need any of them).
;; If you use ff-paths version >= 3.00, load it after ffap.

;; Fancier Setup:
;;
;; ffap has many options.  The next comment block contains some
;; fancier code that you might want to adapt for your .emacs.  For
;; even more features, look at the documentation (M-x apropos ffap),
;; and perhaps check the comments in the "User Variables" and "Peanut
;; Gallery" sections of this file.

;; ;; Before loading ffap:
;;
;; (setq ffap-url-regexp nil)           ; to disable all URL features
;;
;; ;; Loading ffap:
;; (require 'ffap)                      ; as in "Quick Setup" above
;;
;; After loading ffap:
;;
;; (global-set-key "\C-x\C-f" 'find-file-at-point) ; as in "Quick Setup"
;; (global-set-key "\C-x4f" 'ffap-other-window) ; or \C-f
;; (global-set-key "\C-x5f" 'ffap-other-frame) ; or \C-f
;;
;; (setq ffap-alist                     ; remove something in `ffap-alist'
;;	 (delete (assoc 'c-mode ffap-alist) ffap-alist))
;;
;; (setq ffap-alist                     ; add something to `ffap-alist'
;;	 (cons
;;	  (cons "^[Yy][Ss][Nn][0-9]+$"
;;		(defun ffap-ysn (name)
;;		  (concat
;;		   "http://snorri.chem.washington.edu/ysnarchive/issuefiles/"
;;		   (substring name 3) ".html")))
;;	  ffap-alist))
;;
;;
;; Before or after loading ffap:
;;
;; (setq ffap-alist nil)                ; disable all `ffap-alist' actions
;;
;; (setq ffap-require-prefix t)         ; without prefix, ffap == find-file
;;
;; (setq ffap-machine-p-known 'accept)  ; to avoid pinging
;;
;; ;; Choose a mouse binding appropriate for your emacs version:
;; (global-set-key [S-mouse-1] 'ffap-at-mouse) ; Emacs 19
;; (global-set-key [(meta button1)] 'ffap-at-mouse) ; XEmacs
;; (and window-system 			; Emacs 18 (from .emacs)
;;      (setq window-setup-hook
;;            '(lambda nil (define-key mouse-map x-button-s-left
;;                           'ffap-at-mouse))))
;;
;; ;; Use Netscape instead of w3 to fetch URL's.  Mosaic is very similar.
;; (if (eq window-system 'x)
;;     (progn
;;       ;; Get browse-url at http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/emacs/browse-url.el,
;;	 ;; or get a (probably out of date) copy from the ftp site above.
;;	 (autoload 'browse-url-netscape "browse-url" nil t)
;;	 (setq ffap-url-fetcher 'browse-url-netscape)))
;; ;; Or for a hairier ffap-url-fetcher, get ffap-url.el (same ftp site).
;;
;; ;; Support for gnus, vm, rmail (see hook definitions for bindings):
;; (add-hook 'gnus-summary-mode-hook 'ffap-gnus-hook)
;; (add-hook 'gnus-article-mode-hook 'ffap-gnus-hook)
;; (add-hook 'vm-mode-hook 'ffap-ro-mode-hook)
;; (add-hook 'rmail-mode-hook 'ffap-ro-mode-hook)


;;; Related packages:
;;
;; If you have hyperbole, you may not need this package, although ffap
;; is smaller and smarter at this particular task.  Also note that w3
;; (ftp.cs.indiana.edu:/pub/elisp/w3/README) offers a similar command
;; w3-follow-url-at-point.
;;
;; The browse-url package (above) notices URL's at point and hands
;; them off to w3 or an external viewer.  I have also heard of
;; something called goto-url.el.


;;; Examples:
;;
;; Try M-x find-file-at-point (maybe {C-x C-f}) on these examples.
;; These local file examples use ordinary find-file:
;;
;;    ffap.el, /etc/motd, $MAIL     -- find local or absolute files
;;    .emacs book.sty info/cl pwd.h -- search paths depending on filename
;;    (require 'rmail)              -- search paths depending on major-mode
;;    file:/etc/motd                -- depends on `ffap-url-unwrap-local'
;;
;; These remote file examples work if you have ange-ftp or efs:
;;
;;    ftp:/pub                      -- no ping (always works)
;;    ftp.x.org:README              -- no ping, a nice recursive example
;;    anonymous@ftp.x.org:/README   -- synonym
;;    ftp.x.org://README            -- synonym
;;    ftp://ftp.x.org/README        -- depends on `ffap-url-unwrap-remote'
;;    ftp.mathcs.emory.edu          -- depends on `ffap-machine-p-known'
;;    mic@ftp:/                     -- depends on `ffap-machine-p-local'
;;    ftp.mathcs.emory.edu:/        -- depends on `ffap-ftp-sans-slash-regexp'
;;
;; These URL examples use `ffap-url-fetcher' (default w3-fetch):
