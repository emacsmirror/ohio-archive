;;; Commentary:

;;; It is usual when distributing a set of files to give them a
;;; constant header or banner (sometimes with a pleasant
;;; drawing). Some packages do that with some parameters (autoinsert,
;;; auto-template, defaultcontent and others, all in LCD). But very
;;; often, one wants to change the banner and it is a pain to
;;; consistently update all the files of a distribution to reflect
;;; that new banner. This package addresses this point and is
;;; compatible with the defaultcontent.el package.

;;; Whenever a file is visited, its banner is automatically inspected
;;; and updated if needed. A hook is run that knows about the various
;;; possible banners (antichronologically ordered), identifies which
;;; one is used and replace it by the newest possible. When you decide
;;; to change the banner you just add the new one in front of the
;;; possible banners and that's all!

;;; The interactive function db-check-file allows to run the hook even
;;; if not installed. Another function db-check-every-file updates all
;;; the files given in argument. 

;;; To use this package, add to your .emacs (taking care of load-path)
;;;          (require 'defaultbanner)
;;; and it is ready. Then you have to set up the db-banners-alist 
;;; variable to determine which files must be updated wrt which banners.

;;; Demonstration:

;;; (i) load the defaultbanner package 
;;; (ii) visit a file named "foo.bar"
;;;	defaultbanner will see that it does not contain any banner
;;;	and will insert ";;; This is a boring banner." 
;;; (iii) Move to the "foo.bar" buffer
;;;	You can even add some lines before and after the banner but
;;;	do not try to modify it (or at least leave the word banner in it :)
;;; (iv) Do \M-x db-demo
;;;	This will install a new banner associated to foo.bar and 
;;;	and will visit again the foo.bar file thus forcing the banner
;;;	to be updated. 
;;; (v) Look!
;;;	a single undo will remove the change.

;;; Repository:

;;; Newer versions will be sent to the LCD Archive but may appear earlier
;;; on ftp.inria.fr:INRIA/Projects/icsla/Miscellaneous/defaultbanner.el
;;; Other Emacs packages can be found with World Wide Web with URL:

;;; two last entries there are for documentation, more on them at the end

  "DefaultBanner Package from Christian.Queinnec@INRIA.fr

The db-banners-alist holds an Alist that specifies the files whose
banners have to be checked.  Elements of this Alist looks like (REGEXP
NAME . FENDER). If a file is visited whose name matches one of the
REGEXP (and if FENDER is present and evaluates to true), then the
first lines (as controlled by db-maximal-line variable) of the file
are checked with respect to the value of the variable NAME.

The NAME variable must have a value structured as a list of possible
banners ie a list of strings. The first string represents the up to
date banner to insert, the remaining strings represent obsolete
banners that should be replaced if still present in the file. If no
obsolete banner is recognized, the up to date banner is inserted
starting at db-starting-line. " )

;;; When a banner is inserted for the first time, it is inserted at
;;; the line specified by the following variable.

(defvar db-starting-line 2
  "This is the line number starting at which a banner should be inserted." )

;;; To avoid looking for large parts of files, banners are only looked
;;; for in the first lines of a file as specified by the following
;;; varable.

(defvar db-maximal-line 25
  "This is the last line where the banner can appear. 
No banner are searched beyond that limit." )

;;; Controls what the user will see.

(defvar db-verbose t
  "This variable tells if true what defaultbanner does." )

;;; end of public variables.
;;;ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

(defvar db-obsolete-banner-hook nil
  "This hook is run by DefaultBanner just before an obsolete banner is to be
replaced by the up to date banner. It can also be used to make the buffer
writable perhaps by retrieving a new version of the file." )

(defvar db-absent-banner-hook nil
  "This hook is run by DefaultBanner when no banner is found, just before the
up to date banner is to be inserted. It can also be used to make the buffer
writable perhaps by retrieving a new version of the file." )

;;; These two hooks can be used with the vc (version control) package
;;; to retrieve new versions. A possible value is:
;;; (add-hook 'db-obsolete-banner-hook 'vc-toggle-read-only)
;;; (add-hook 'db-absent-banner-hook 'vc-toggle-read-only)

;;; This is the heart of the package. It explores the current buffer
;;; to substitute old banners by the new one or insert the new one if
;;; no older one is found. If an obsolete banner is replaced, the
;;; db-obsolete-banner-hook is run just before. If no banner was
;;; present, the db-absent-banner-hook is run ust before the insertion
;;; of the up to date banner. 

;;; If you are disatisfied with the new banner, a simple undo will
;;; restaure the previous state. If the buffer is readonly, run one of
;;; the hooks then restart the whole process since if the file is
;;; checked out, its content may have changed. The hook may trigger
;;; db-check-buffer so we must avoid a double update of the banner.
