;;; Commentary:

;; This program was inspired by the behavior of the Lisp Machine "mouse
;; documentation window"; as you type a function's symbol name as part of a
;; sexp, it will print the argument list for that function.  However, this
;; program's behavior is different in a couple of significant ways.  For
;; one, you need not actually type the function name; you need only move
;; point around in a sexp that calls it.  However, if point is over a
;; documented variable, it will print the one-line documentation for that
;; variable instead, to remind you of that variable's purpose.

;; One useful way to enable this minor mode is to put the following in your
;; .emacs:
;;
;;      (autoload 'turn-on-eldoc-mode "eldoc" nil t)
;;      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
;;      (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)

;;; Code:

  "*If non-nil, show the defined parameters for the elisp function near point.

For the emacs lisp function at the beginning of the sexp which point is
within, show the defined parameters for the function in the echo area.
This information is extracted directly from the function or macro if it is
in pure lisp.

If the emacs function is a subr, the parameters are obtained from the
documentation string if possible.

If point is over a documented variable, print that variable's docstring
instead; see function `eldoc-print-var-docstring'.
