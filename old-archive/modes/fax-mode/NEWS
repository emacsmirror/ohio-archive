User visible changes from version 1.0 to 1.1:

* Added support for Font-Lock mode.  Please note that there is a clear
race condition between Font-Lock mode and WYSIWYG fashioned text editing.

* TeXfax now works `out of the box'.

* New minor mode for Dired called `Faxed'.  Allows to view fax messages
by simply pressing `v', try `M-x faxed <fax-incoming-directory> RET'.

* Extra command line switches, e.g., fax transmit time, can be specified
with one or more `Options:' header fields in the `*fax*' buffer.

* If the buffer-local variable `sendfax-format' is non-`nil', run the
corresponding functions saved in `sendfax-formats'.  `sendfax-format'
can be set with `sendfax-change-format' or with the `Format:' header
field in the `*fax*' buffer.

* `sendfax-write-region-hooks' and `sendfax-write-region-function'
are now buffer-local variables.  The default value have to be set with
`setq-default' while `setq' only modifies the buffer-local value.
