This is Jim's Pretty-Good Shell Mode (J-Shell), a shell-mode for GNU Emacs.

NOTE: Version 2.1 fixes a problem in running J-Shell under FSF
      Emacs version 19.24 and later.  J-Shell 2.1 should also work
      with earlier versions of FSF Emacs 19, Lucid Emacs 19
      (XEmacs), and Emacs 18.

J-Shell is a shell mode derived from Emacs 18's shell mode (although
it has been changed so much that it bears little resemblance to the
original).  J-Shell's features include:

  *  Accurate working-directory tracking

  *  Filename completion

  *  Command completion

  *  Environment variable completion, substitution, and tracking

  *  Host tracking and a simple interface to ange-ftp

  *  A browseable command history stack

  *  Password detection and hiding (with some security features)

  *  Automatic generation of new buffers

  *  Input buffering (a fix for the ^G problem)

J-Shell can be used with most popular shells; the exception is sh, which
cannot be used because it provides no means of aliasing its cd command.
(You *could* use sh with J-Shell, but you would have no directory
tracking.)  Sh users would be better off using the shell-mode that comes
with Emacs.

Note that J-Shell requires that you modify your shell's startup
script so that it can communicate with J-Shell.  This is how J-Shell
achieves its directory and environment variable tracking.  If you
you're not comfortable modifying your startup script, then J-Shell is
probably not for you.

See the file DOC for instructions on using J-Shell
