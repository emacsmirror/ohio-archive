This message announces the availability of cc-mode version 4.282.
cc-mode is a GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++,
Objective-C, and Java code.  The last full release was of version
4.241.  Java support is new in this version; a list of user visible
changes is outlined below.  See the MANIFEST file for a description of
other files included in this release.

Since the distribution is fairly large and since it is readily
available both via anonymous ftp and email, the source code is not
being posted here.  Downloading instructions are provided further down
in this message.

NOTE: XEmacs 19.14 and Emacs 19.31 will both contain, and be
configured to use, the latest version of cc-mode.  Both editors are in
beta testing, and nope! I don't know when they will be released.

If you want to become a beta tester send subscribe requests to
cc-mode-victims-request@merlin.cnri.reston.va.us.  If you just want
announcements of new versions, send subscribe requests to
cc-mode-announce-request@merlin.cnri.reston.va.us.  These mailing
lists are maintained by the Majordomo automated mailing list software.

NOTE: Since I discovered Python, I have severely curtailed my (ab)use
of C (and derivative) languages, and since I use Grail, I haven't
started hacking Java yet! :-) So my motivation for maintaining this
mode is waning, and I'm looking for volunteers to either take over or
help out with bits and pieces.  If you're interested and have a solid
Emacs Lisp programming background, send me email at the cc-mode-help
address above.

Oh and a few shameless plugs.  For more information on Python see
<http://www.python.org/>, and for more information on Grail, see

User visible changes since 4.282
================================

* Java mode added.  Initial impetus thanks to Eduardo Pelegri-Llopart.

* New command c-electric-lt-gt, bound to `<' and `>' in C++ mode.

* imenu support added for Emacs 19.

* Style names are now case insensitive, but default to lower case.

* GNU style nested functions are now (semi-)supported.

* New variable c-site-default-style.

* Bug fixes!

Getting cc-mode.el
===================

The canonical ftp site for the full cc-mode tar distribution is:

	ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode.tar.gz

This is a gzip'd tar file containing the .el source code and
documentation, along with sundry other useful files.  See the MANIFEST
a complete list of the contained files.  You can get individual files
from the directory:

	ftp://ftp.python.org/pub/emacs/cc-mode-4.282/

The Emacs Lisp Archive should also contain the full distribution.

For those of you without anon-ftp access, you can use the DEC
ftpmail'er at the address ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com.  Send the following
message in the body of your mail to that address to get cc-mode:

reply <a valid net address back to you>
connect ftp.python.org
binary
uuencode
chdir pub/emacs
get cc-mode.tar.gz

or just send the message "help" for more information on ftpmail.
Response times will vary with the number of requests in the queue.
