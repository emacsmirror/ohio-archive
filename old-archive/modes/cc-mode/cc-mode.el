;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides modes in GNU Emacs for editing C, C++, 
;; Objective-C, and Java code. It is intended to be a replacement for
;; c-mode.el (a.k.a. BOCM -- Boring Old C-Mode), and c++-mode.el
;; (a.k.a cplus-md.el and cplus-md1.el), both of which are ancestors
;; of this file.  A number of important improvements have been made,
;; briefly: complete K&R C, ANSI C, `ARM' C++, Objective-C, and Java
;; support with consistent indentation across all modes, more
;; intuitive indentation controlling variables, compatibility across
;; all known Emacsen, nice new features, and tons of bug fixes.  This
;; package is called "cc-mode" to distinguish it from its ancestors,
;; but there really is no top-level cc-mode.  Usage and programming
;; details are contained in an accompanying texinfo manual.

;; To submit bug reports, type "C-c C-b".  These will be sent to
;; bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu and I'll read about them there (this
;; is mirrored as the Usenet newsgroup gnu.emacs.bug).  Questions can
;; sent to help-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu (mirrored as
;; gnu.emacs.help).  Please do not send bugs or questions to my
;; personal account.

;; YOU CAN IGNORE ALL BYTE-COMPILER WARNINGS. They are the result of
;; the multi-Emacsen support.  Emacs 19 (from the FSF), XEmacs 19
;; (formerly Lucid Emacs), and GNU Emacs 18 all do things differently
;; and there's no way to shut the byte-compiler up at the necessary
;; granularity.  Let me say this again: YOU CAN IGNORE ALL
;; BYTE-COMPILER WARNINGS (you'd be surprised at how many people don't
;; follow this advice :-).

;; If your Emacs is dumped with c-mode.el and/or c++-mode.el, you will
;; need to add the following to your .emacs file before any other
;; reference to c-mode or c++-mode:
;;
;; (fmakunbound 'c-mode)
;; (makunbound 'c-mode-map)
;; (fmakunbound 'c++-mode)
;; (makunbound 'c++-mode-map)
;; (makunbound 'c-style-alist)

;; If your Emacs comes with cc-mode already (and as of 18-Jan-1996,
;; XEmacs 19.13 and Emacs 19.30 both do), you only need to add the
;; following to use the latest version of cc-mode:
;;
;; (load "cc-mode")
;;
;; Make sure the new version is earlier on your load-path.

;; There are four major mode entry points provided by this package,
;; one for editing C++ code, one for editing C code (both K&R and
;; ANSI), one for editing Objective-C code, and one for editing Java
;; code.  The commands are M-x c-mode, M-x c++-mode, M-x objc-mode,
;; and M-x java-mode.

;; If you are using an old version of Emacs which does not come
;; with cc-mode.el, you will need to do these things
;; to use it:
;;
;; (autoload 'c++-mode  "cc-mode" "C++ Editing Mode" t)
;; (autoload 'c-mode    "cc-mode" "C Editing Mode" t)
;; (autoload 'objc-mode "cc-mode" "Objective-C Editing Mode" t)
;; (autoload 'java-mode "cc-mode" "Java Editing Mode" t)
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;   (append '(("\\.C$"    . c++-mode)
;;             ("\\.cc$"   . c++-mode)
;;             ("\\.c$"    . c-mode)
;;             ("\\.h$"    . c-mode)
;;             ("\\.m$"    . objc-mode)
;;             ("\\.java$" . java-mode)
;;            ) auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; You do not need these changes in Emacs versions that come with cc-mode.

;; Many, many thanks go out to all the folks on the beta test list.
;; Without their patience, testing, insight, code contributions, and
;; encouragement cc-mode.el would be a far inferior package.

  "*Association list of syntactic element symbols and indentation offsets.
As described below, each cons cell in this list has the form:

    (SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL . OFFSET)

When a line is indented, cc-mode first determines the syntactic
context of the line by generating a list of symbols called syntactic
elements.  This list can contain more than one syntactic element and
the global variable `c-syntactic-context' contains the context list
for the line being indented.  Each element in this list is actually a
cons cell of the syntactic symbol and a buffer position.  This buffer
position is called the relative indent point for the line.  Some
syntactic symbols may not have a relative indent point associated with
them.

After the syntactic context list for a line is generated, cc-mode
calculates the absolute indentation for the line by looking at each
syntactic element in the list.  First, it compares the syntactic
element against the SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL's in `c-offsets-alist'.  When it
finds a match, it adds the OFFSET to the column of the relative indent
point.  The sum of this calculation for each element in the syntactic
list is the absolute offset for line being indented.

If the syntactic element does not match any in the `c-offsets-alist',
an error is generated if `c-strict-syntax-p' is non-nil, otherwise
the element is ignored.

Actually, OFFSET can be an integer, a function, a variable, or one of
the following symbols: `+', `-', `++', `--', `*', or `/'.  These
latter designate positive or negative multiples of `c-basic-offset',
respectively: *1, *-1, *2, *-2, *0.5, and *-0.5. If OFFSET is a
function, it is called with a single argument containing the cons of
the syntactic element symbol and the relative indent point.  The
function should return an integer offset.

Here is the current list of valid syntactic element symbols:
