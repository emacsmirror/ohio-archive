;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose:
;;
;; To make visiting buffers in `font-lock-mode' faster by making fontification
;; be demand-driven and stealthy.
;; Fontification only occurs when, and where, necessary.
;;
;; See caveats and feedback below.  See also the defer-lock and fast-lock
;; packages.  (But don't use lazy-lock.el and fast-lock.el at the same time!)

;; Installation:
;; 
;; Put this file somewhere where Emacs can find it (i.e., in one of the paths
;; in your `load-path'), `byte-compile-file' it, and put in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;; (autoload 'turn-on-lazy-lock "lazy-lock"
;;   "Unconditionally turn on Lazy Lock mode.")
;;
;; (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook 'turn-on-lazy-lock)
;;
;; Start up a new Emacs and use font-lock as usual (except that you can use the
;; so-called "gaudier" fontification regexps on big files without frustration).
;;
;; In a buffer (which has `font-lock-mode' enabled) which is at least
;; `lazy-lock-minimum-size' characters long, only the visible portion of the
;; buffer will be fontified.  Motion around the buffer will fontify those
;; visible portions that were not previous fontified.  If the variable
;; `lazy-lock-hide-invisible' is non-nil, redisplay will be delayed until after
;; fontification.  Otherwise, text that has not yet been fontified is displayed
;; in `lazy-lock-invisible-foreground'.
;;
;; If stealth fontification is enabled, fontification will occur in invisible
;; parts of the buffer after `lazy-lock-stealth-time' seconds of idle time.

;; Advanced Use:
;;
;; You can also do fancy things with `advice'.  For example, to fontify when
;; dragging the scroll-bar in Emacs, you could put in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;; (autoload 'lazy-lock-post-command-fontify-windows "lazy-lock")
;;
;; (defadvice scroll-bar-drag-1 (after fontify-window activate compile)
;;   (let ((lazy-lock-walk-windows nil) (lazy-lock-hide-invisible nil))
;;     (lazy-lock-post-command-fontify-windows)))
;;
;; Or to fontify when the Debugger pops up a source code window:
;;
;; (autoload 'lazy-lock-fontify-walk-windows "lazy-lock")
;;
;; (defadvice gud-display-line (after fontify-window activate compile)
;;   (let ((lazy-lock-walk-windows t) (lazy-lock-hide-invisible t))
;;     (lazy-lock-fontify-walk-windows)))
;;
;; Scott Byer <byer@mv.us.adobe.com> suggested this to fontify the visible part
;; of an insertion only:
;;
;; (defvar lazy-lock-insert-commands
;;   '(yank yank-pop clipboard-yank hilit-yank hilit-yank-pop 
;;     mail-yank-original mouse-yank-at-click mouse-yank-secondary
;;     yank-rectangle)
;;   "A list of insertion commands.")
;;
;; (defadvice font-lock-after-change-function (around fontify-insertion
;;                                             activate compile)
;;   (if (or (not (memq this-command lazy-lock-insert-commands))
;; 	  (and (pos-visible-in-window-p beg) (pos-visible-in-window-p end)))
;;       ad-do-it
;;     (let ((this-command 'ignore))
;;       (put-text-property beg end 'fontified nil)
;;       (lazy-lock-fontify-window))))
;;
;; Let me know if you use any other `advice' and I'll put it here.  Thanks.
;;
;; These kinds of things with `advice' aren't done automatically because they
;; cause large packages (advice.el plus bytecomp.el and friends) to be loaded.

;; Caveats:
;;
;; Lazy Lock mode does not work efficiently with Outline mode.  This is because
;; when in Outline mode, although text may be hidden (not visible in the
;; window), the text is visible to Emacs Lisp code (not surprisingly) and Lazy
;; Lock fontifies it mercilessly.  Hopefully this will be fixed one day.
;;
;; Lazy Lock mode does not fontify windows as they appear:
;;
;; 1.  With `query-replace' or `ispell-*', as Lazy Lock only knows about point
;; motion after the command exits.
;;
;; 2.  When displayed by gud.el (the Grand Unified Debugger), as they are
;; displayed via a process sentinel.  See `Advanced Use' above.
;;
;; 3.  In XEmacs 19.12, when the last command was invoked via a mouse event,
;; because of a bug/feature in/of `sit-for'.
;;
;; 4.  In other random situations that I don't know about (yet).
;;
;; If you have `lazy-lock-hide-invisible' you may notice that redisplay occurs
;; before fontification regardlessly.  This is due to other packages sitting on
;; `post-command-hook' and provoking redisplay.  If you use these packages, you
;; can't use `lazy-lock-hide-invisible'.
;;
;; If you have `lazy-lock-hide-invisible' and use scrollbar scrolling using
;; Emacs 19, hidden text will not be fontified as it becomes visible.  It is
;; expected that Emacs 19 will provide the necessary hooks in future, to solve
;; this problem and the problem above.
;;
;; Unless otherwise stated, "Emacs 19.X" means versions up to and including X.
;;
;; In Emacs 19.25, one `window-start'/`window-end' bug means that if you open a
;; file in another frame (such as via `find-tag-other-frame'), the whole buffer
;; is fontified regardless.  Upgrade!
;;
;; In Emacs 19.25, fontification by stealth is turned off because of a fatal
;; bug in `previous-single-property-change'.  Upgrade!
;;
;; In Emacs 19.28, if you see a message in the minibuffer of the form
;;  "Fontifying window... done.  (Restarted in foo.c)"
;; it means the Garbage Collector has marked some (subsequently used) text
;; properties.  Lazy Lock attempts to recover the situation by restarting in
;; that buffer.  Unfortunately, that buffer will be left in a writable and
;; modified state.  Also, other windows may not be fontified when this happens.
;; To reduce the frequency of this bug occuring, increase in your ~/.emacs the
;; value of `gc-cons-threshold' to, say, 1Meg, e.g.:
;;
;; (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 1024 1024))
;;
;; The solution is to upgrade!  (With thanks to Kevin Broadey for help here.)
;;
;; For XEmacs 19.11 and Lucid Emacs 19.10 users, lazy-lock sort-of works.
;; There are bugs in text property and point/window primatives.  Upgrade!
