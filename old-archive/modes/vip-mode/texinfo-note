The new texinfo release uses a font "lcircle10" that's sometimes
called "circle10" in older TeX distributions.  If your system has
trouble using the new texinfo, giving the error message

! Font \circle=lcircle10 not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found.

you can probably get around the problem if you have the older version
of the font, "circle10".  Since the emerging convention is to use the
new name, we don't recommend you change texinfo.tex; instead, look for 
files like these on your system:

    circle10.mf
         This is the Metafont souce for the font; sometimes used
         automatically by dvi output programs to generate pixel files.

    circle10.tfm
         This is the file actually used by TeX; it describes the
         measurements of the characters in the font.

    circle10.300pk
    circle10.96pk
        "pk" files contain the actual pixels for the character images;
        used by your dvi output program.

Establish links to each of these files so they're available with both
the "circle10" and the "lcircle10" prefix (if possible, using the ln
`-s' option so you can more easily keep track of what happened), for
example (in the directory where you found circle10.tfm on your
system):

   ln -s circle10.tfm lcircle10.tfm

The files whose names end in "pk" may have other numbers where our
example shows "300" and "96".  You may also have more, or fewer, pk
files than in our example.  Don't worry about this; just link each
of the circle10 pk files you do have to the corresponding lcircle10 pk
file.  For example (usually all the pk files are in a single
directory, though it's not always the same as the directory for mf or
tfm files):

  for pk in circle10.*pk; do ln -s $pk l$pk; done
