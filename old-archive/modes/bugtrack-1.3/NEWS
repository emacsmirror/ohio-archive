New features in bugtrack 1.3 (1994-01-06)
-----------------------------------------

+ You can set ``bugtrack-auto-mail-file-list'' to a list of RMAIL file
  names.  All commands which searches for messages by Message-id will
  search in them, as well as in all RMAIL buffers currently present in
  your emacs, before prompting you for the file to search in.

+ A number of bugs, most of them having to do with missing or
  unnecessary autoloads, were fixed.

+ ``bugtrack-other-frame'' is to ``bugtrack'' what
  ``find-file-other-frame'' is to ``find-file''.

+ The variable ``bugtrack-rmail-create-bug-where'' lets you decide if
  the Bugtrack buffer should overlay the RMAIL buffer or be displayed
  in another window or frame when ``bugtrack-rmail-create-bug'' is
  used.


New features in bugtrack 1.2 (1994-01-01)
-----------------------------------------

+ You can now teach Bugtrack where bug reports should be stored.  The
  variable ``bugtrack-rmail-rules'' holds rules such as "if the regexp
  [bB]ugtrack appears in a mail, the bug should go to
  ~/bugtrack/BUGS".  The result of applying the rules in
  ``bugtrack-rmail-rules'' becomes the default filename when you use
  ``bugtrack-rmail-create-bug''; you can always override it.

+ Bugtrack can optionally insert a magic cookie (such as
  ##Bugtrack-bug-67##) into the Subject field of the mail you create a
  bug report from.  If you reply to the bug report, and get a reply to
  your reply, and it still contains the magic cookie, Bugtrack can use
  it to quickly locate the corresponding entry in a Bugtrack file.
  The variable ``bugtrack-rmail-subject-cookie-map'' determines how
  this works.

+ ``bugtrack-submit-bug-report'' can be used to submit a bug report
  about Bugtrack.

+ Pressing ``a'' in a Bugtrack buffer prompts for a ChangeLog, and
  adds a header such as ``* Id 51: Generate ChangeLog headings.'' in
  it.

+ The variable ``bugtrack-default-dir'' can be useful if you tend to
  store several Bugtrack files in a single directory.

+ Some minor bugs were fixed.

New features in bugtrack 1.1 (1993-12-25)
-----------------------------------------

This is mainly a bug-fix release.

+ Two new commands: pressing SPC and DEL in the summary buffer scrolls
  the corresponding bug buffer. 

+ bugtrack-rmail-search-msg-id now searches closed as well as active
  bugs for the email.

+ Five minor bugs fixed (see the ChangeLog).

New features in bugtrack 1.0 (1993-12-13)
-----------------------------------------

This is the first release made to a wider audience, and also the first
release that gets a release number.

+ Tighter coupling to RMAIL: hit "F" in RMAIL mode to search for bug
  reports that refer to the current mail.

+ The new file bugtrack-init.el should be loaded from your .emacs (or,
  possibly, from default.el).  It is no longer necessary to load
  bugtrack.el before rmail.el to get the RMAIL coupling to work.

+ As a bonus, added bugtrack-rmail-view-commented (bound to "^" in
  RMAIL mode).

- Emacs 18 is no longer supported.
