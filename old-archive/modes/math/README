This directory contains files for the GNU Emacs interface to
Mathematica.  

math-mode.el and mathtalk.el run in Emacs and should
be moved into a directory that is in your Emacs load-path and
byte-compiled.  The binaries emacsfrontend and macnb2nbl should
be moved to a directory on your Unix shell path.  (If macnb2nbl is
not included, just make it with "make macnb2nbl".)  Various versions
may be included in this tar file for sun3 and sun4, and mathematica 1.1
and 1.2.  Move the appropriate files to the right places.

Print the math-mode.texinfo manual by running TeX on it (first
make a link to the texinfo.tex macros: 
ln -s <emacsdir>/man/texinfo.tex texinfo.tex) 
Copy the math-mode info file to your local info directory and add
an entry like the following to the info/dir file:

* Math-mode: (math-mode).       Mathematica interface.

Read the first couple sections of the manual, particularly
"Setting up math-mode".

If there are problems with math-mode, first try outputting
some debugging info with (setq debug-on-error t) and
(setq math-show-debug t).  Send me the output if
you cant figure it out.

Good luck, and enjoy.
