This is GNU Emacs 'multi forms-mode', version 1.4 (patchlevel 0).

This GNU Emacs major mode implements editing a structured file (i.e., a
file with 'records' and 'fields' in it) using a form.
It is fully documented in the source file 'forms.el' and in the
now out of date texinfo file 'forms.ti'.  (forms.ti was written for
forms-mode version 1.2, and has not been brought up to date.  More of
it is correct than incorrect, so I (FR) include it with version 1.4.)

This kit contains:

	README		- this file
	MANIFEST	- list of files (no longer included)
	forms.ti	- texinfo file for forms-mode 1.2
	forms.el	- the lisp source
	demo1		- simple demo using /etc/passwd
                          one record/buffer at a time
	test.forms 	- advanced demo
                          multiple records/buffer at a time

Load the lisp source, and execute

	forms-find-file demo1

to look at your password file in a unconventional (but read-only) way.

find-file test.forms

gives you something with multiple records to clobber,
with data and multi-line fields.
