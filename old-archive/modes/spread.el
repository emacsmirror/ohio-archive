  "Major mode for simple spreadsheets.

Quick reference:

    jump to => on this line (or add one)   \\[spread-jump-to-formula] 


OVERVIEW
--------

A spreadsheet is an ordinary text buffer with embedded \"cells\" of
the form

       VALUE <= FORMULA 

or

       VALUE <= FORMULA => NAME

where

    * VALUE, the current value of the cell, is a single word (typically a 
      number);
    * FORMULA is an arbitrary lisp expression, used to recalculate VALUE; and
    * NAME, if present, is a lisp variable to which VALUE is assigned 
      after each recomputation.

A single recalculation step consists of scanning the buffer, recalculating
each cell by replacing the current VALUE by the result of evaluating FORMULA.
A complete recalculation, triggered by typing \\[spread-recalc], iterates this process
until the buffer stops changing.

When a old value is replaced, the first character of the newly
computed value is placed in the same column as the first character of
the old.  If the values are numeric, the new value is truncated to the
same number of decimal places as the old.  The spacing of the
remainder of the line is preserved.


FORMULAS
--------

The formula associated with a cell may be just a constant.  This form is 
useful for making names for common constants; e.g.:

        10 <= 10 => length

More generally, a formula may involve arbitrary arithmetic calculations
including variables whose values are set by other cells:

        555   <= 555 => breadth
        5550  <= (* length breadth) => area
       $29137 <= (* area 5.25)   => total-cost

One very useful lisp function is predefined for use in formulas: the
expression (total) returns the sum of the column of numbers appearing
above the value part of the current cell.  (More precisely, it moves
the cursor upwards, beginning at the leftmost character of the current
value, till it finds a number; then it continues upward until it fails
to find a number beginning in this column.  The result is the sum of
all the numbers in between.)  For example:

                  $25   
                  $29137                 <= total-cost
                  $55   
                  $888  
                  $-20
                  ========
     total cost:  $30085                 <= (total)

Note that:
   1) All the numbers in the list must be left-justified for
      (total) to work properly.
   2) The dollar signs can be contiguous with the numbers, since they are 
      not considered part of the values.
   3) The line above the total is composed of equal-signs, not dashes,
      since these would be misinterpreted as negation-signs.

In Emacs version 19 (both FSF and Lucid), floating-point numbers may
also be used in formulas.  If the value part of a formula is written
with a decimal point, new values will be truncated to the same length 
when it is updated.

Another useful function is (date-and-time), which returns the current
date and time compressed into a single word:

              Nov-18-1993-19:18    <= (date-and-time)  


EDITING
-------

Spread-mode provides some simple support for editing spreadsheets:
    * \\[overwrite-mode] toggles overwrite mode (q.v.)
    * \\[spread-format-next-cell] formats the next cell so that the => appears 
      exactly under the => of the previous cell
    * \\[spread-jump-to-formula] moves the cursor to the formula of the cell on the current
      line, or (if the current line does not contain =>) jumps to the
      same column as the previous cell's => and adds a =>.

Besides the keybindings described above, the bindings of spread-mode
are just like those of text-mode.


CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

Invoking spread-mode calls the value of text-mode-hook and then of
spread-mode-hook, if they are non-nil."
