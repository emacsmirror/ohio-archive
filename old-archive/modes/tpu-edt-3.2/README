    **  Announcing TPU-edt 3.2 -- emacs emulating TPU emulating EDT  **

    TPU-edt features the following TPU/edt functionality:

     .  EDT keypad
     .  On-line help
     .  Repeat counts
     .  Scroll margins
     .  Learn sequences
     .  Free cursor mode
     .  Rectangular cut and paste
     .  Multiple windows and buffers
     .  TPU line-mode REPLACE command
     .  Wild card search and substitution
     .  Configurable through an initialization file
     .  History recall of search strings, file names, and commands

    Including support for:

     .  Emacs version 19
     .  X-windows (with emacs version 19)

    TPU-edt works on any VT-series compatible terminal or emulator, is
    easy to install and use, and even comes with  an UNDO function not
    available in TPU.  Try TPU-edt today.   We think you'll agree that
    it does a lot better TPU/edt emulation than vi!

    Please note that TPU-edt does NOT emulate TPU.   It emulates TPU's
    EDT emulation.  Very few TPU line-mode commands are supported.

    tpu-doc.el contains installation and usage instructions.
