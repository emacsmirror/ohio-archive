    If you're a new TPU-edt user, skip this notice.

    If you're upgrading from TPU-edt version 3.0 or lower, read on...
    
    Some of the file names in the TPU-edt package have been changed.  The
    name changes were necessary for TPU-edt to be included in the standard
    EMACS distribution.  Starting with EMACS version 19.19 you'll no longer
    need to pick up TPU-edt from the elisp archives.
    
    The file name changes are as follows:
    
        tpu-edt-doc.el      -->  tpu-doc.el
        tpu-edt-extras.el   -->  tpu-extras.el
        tpu-edt-history.el  -->  tpu-recall.el
        tpu-edt-mapper.el   -->  tpu-mapper.el
    
    Fortunately, the base TPU-edt file, tpu-edt.el, did not undergo a name
    change, so if you're not using the extended features in "-extras" and
    "-recall" no changes are necessary.  If you are using the extended
    features, you can probably handle making the necessary changes to your
    .emacs file.

    Sorry for the inconvenience...
