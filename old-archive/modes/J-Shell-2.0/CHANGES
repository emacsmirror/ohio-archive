Changes for version 2.0

* Added command completion.

* Added environment variable completion, substitution, and tracking.

* Added to the filter function the ability to reconstruct fragmented
  messages from the shell.

* Fixed a bug that caused J-Shell to stomp on the value of
  case-fold-search.

* Added jsh-completion-separator so filename completion works in
  contexts such as "export LOCALDIR=/usr/loc".

* J-Shell now works in all Emacsen.

* Added support of Barry Warsaw's reporter package for reporting bugs.


NOTE: To report bugs use the C-c C-b binding.  See file DOC, section BUGS.


Changes for version 1.1

* Corrected a bug in jsh-hide-lossage that prevented password detection
  from working for users of Emacs versions 18.57 and earlier.  For these
  Emacs versions, J-Shell no longer opens dribble-file nil to close the
  dribble file; instead, it opens dribble-file /dev/null.

* Changed jsh-start-program to use the env program in (exec-directory)/etc,
  rather than assuming it is in /bin/env.

* Fixed a bug in the startup script for ksh.

* Moved the contents of README into DOC.

* Corrected some misinformation in DOC and added some caveats.
