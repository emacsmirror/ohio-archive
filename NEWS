I forgot to update this file after updating the web page; the OSU
Emacs Lisp archive is closed while a merge with Lispmeralda
(www.lispmeralda.org) takes place.  We hope to accomplish this soon.
Thanks for your patience!

Good news!  The Ohio State Emacs Lisp Archive is now being actively
maintained again.  We are still trying to catch up on organizing the
entries.  Our current project is to create a common archive entry
format.  However, submissions are being taken, currently by hand.
Please see the file SUBMISSIONS.
