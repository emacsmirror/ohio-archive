;;; Commentary:

;; Highlights the line the cursor is inYou can change colors of foreground
;; (text) and background. Highlighting is (currently) switched on in ALL
;; buffers including minibuffers. Default behaviour is to set only background
;; color, so that font-lock fontification colors remain visible (syntax
;; coloring).  See functions `highlight-current-line-on',
;; `highlight-current-line-set-fg-color',
;; `highlight-current-line-set-bg-color'. There's a special color "none"
;; defined to set no color.

;; You can select whether the whole line (from left to right window border)
;; is marked or only the really filled parts of the line (from left window
;; border to the last char in the line). The second behaviour is suitable if
;; its important for you to see trailing spaces or tabs in a line. See
;; function `highlight-current-line-whole-line-on'. In XEmacs this is hardly
;; to recognize, cause there the region is a notch more extended.

;; You can ignore buffers, whose buffer-name match some regular expression,
;; so they never get highlighted. Some buffers are ignored by default, see
;; variable `highlight-current-line-ignore-regexp'. You can extend or
;; redefine this regexp. This works together with the default ignore function
;; `highlight-current-line-ignore-function'. You can redefine this function
;; to implement your own criterias.

;;; People which made contributions or suggestions:

;; This list is ordered by time. Latest in time first.
;; - Masatake Yamato <jet@gyve.org>
;; - Hrvoje Niksic	 <hniksic@srce.hr>
;; - Jari Aalto		 <jari.aalto@ntc.nokia.com>
;; - Shawn Ostermann <sdo@picard.cs.OhioU.Edu>
;; - Peter Ikier	 <p_ikier@infoac.rmi.de>
;;   Many thanks to him for the idea. He liked this behaviour in another
;;   editor ("Q").

;;; Installation:

;; e.g. in .emacs
;; (require 'highlight-current-line)
;; ;; If you want to mark only to the end of line:
;; (highlight-current-line-whole-line-on nil)
;; ;; switch highlighting on
;; (highlight-current-line-on t)
;;
;; ;; If you want to change default-foreground/background color add something
;; ;; like:
;; (highlight-current-line-set-fg-color "red")
;; (highlight-current-line-set-bg-color "white")
;; ;; There's a special color "none" defined to set no color.
;;
;; ;; Ignore no buffer
;; (setq highlight-current-line-ignore-regexp nil) ; or set to ""
;; ;; alternate way to ignore no buffers
;; (fmakunbound 'highlight-current-line-ignore-function)
;; ;; Ignore more buffers
;; (setq highlight-current-line-ignore-regexp
;;      (concat "Dilberts-Buffer\\|"
;;	      highlight-current-line-ignore-regexp))
;;
;; Put a copy of highlight-current-line.el/.elc into some path of
;; `load-path'. To show `load-path': <C-h v> load-path RET
;;

;;; Troubleshooting:

;; - Q: I do not see matching parens from paren.el any more!
;; - A: Check the colors from highlight-current-line or from show-paren-face
;;   and choose some combination which works together.

;;; ToDo:

;; - highlight paragraphs, functions etc... (suggestion by Daniel Lundin
;;   <daniel@emacs.org> 19 Dec 1999)
;; - provide overlay priorities
;;   (overlay-put highlight-current-line-overlay 'priority 60)
;; - better way to switch off 'ignore buffer'
;; - face fore/backgroundcolor depending on major-mode
;; - better way to detect xemacs

;; - some suggestions for default keys
;; - highlight-current-line as minor mode. Suggested by Shawn Ostermann.

;;; Change log:

;; 15 Jul 2000 - v0.52:
;; - Masatake YAMATO: added emacsclient / gnudoit support. Invoking emacs
;;   to load a file from external, highlight-current-line couldn't
;;   initially show the line of the loaded file highlighted.

;; 19 Oct 1997 - v0.51:
;; - uses defcustom-library if available. Suggested by Jari Aalto and Hrvoje
;;   Niksic.
;; - logic error in if-condition of post-command-hook. All Buffers were
;;   ignored if highlight-current-line-ignore-function was unbound.

;; 18 Oct 1997 - v0.5:
;; - GNU General Public License
;; - ignore user-definable buffernames which are ignored for
;;   highlighting. Suggested by Jari Aalto.
;; - works with XEmacs, at least version 19.15. Mark whole line doesnt work
;;   yet. Suggested by Jari Aalto.
;; - highlight-current-line-set-fg/bg-color understand "none" as color
;; - overlay-put moved from post-command-hook to initialization-code
;; - version-variable: `highlight-current-line-version'. Always
;;   "major.minor". Suggested by Jari Aalto.

;; 11 Oct 1997 - v0.4:
;; - Possibility to highlight whole line (from left to right windowborder) or
;;   only from left window border to the last char in the line.
;;
;; 20 Aug 1997 - v0.3:
;; - First public released version.
