@chapter Introduction to AUC TeX

This section of the AUC @TeX{} manual gives a brief overview of what AUC
@TeX{} is, and the section is also available as a @file{README} file.
It is @strong{not} an attempt to document AUC @TeX{}.  Real
documentation for AUC @TeX{} is available in the rest of the manual,
which you can find in the @file{doc} directory.

Read the @file{INSTALLATION} file for information about how to install
AUC @TeX{}.  It is identical to the Installation chapter in the AUC
@TeX{} manual.

If you are upgrading from the previous version of AUC @TeX{}, the
latest changes can be found in the @file{CHANGES} file.  If you are
upgrading from an older version, read the History chapter in the AUC
@TeX{} manual.

AUC @TeX{} is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
writing input files for La@TeX{} using GNU Emacs.

AUC @TeX{} lets you run @TeX{}/La@TeX{} and other La@TeX{}-related
tools, such as a output filters or post processor from inside Emacs.
Especially `running La@TeX{}' is interesting, as AUC @TeX{} lets you
browse through the errors @TeX{} reported, while it moves the cursor
directly to the reported error, and displays some documentation for that
particular error.  This will even work when the document is spread over
several files.

AUC @TeX{} automatically indents your `La@TeX{}-source', not only as you
write it --- you can also let it indent and format an entire document.
It has a special outline feature, which can greatly help you `getting an
overview' of a document.

Apart from these special features, AUC @TeX{} provides a large range of
handy Emacs macros, which in several different ways can help you write
your La@TeX{} documents fast and painlessly.

All features of AUC @TeX{} are documented using the GNU Emacs online
documentation system.  That is, documentation for any command is just
a key click away!

AUC @TeX{} is written entirely in Emacs-Lisp, and hence you can easily
add new features for your own needs.  It was not made as part of any
particular employment or project (apart from the AUC @TeX{} project
itself).  AUC @TeX{} is distributed under the `GNU Emacs General Public
License' and may therefore almost freely be copied and redistributed.

The next sections are a short introduction to some `actual' features.
For further information, refer to the built-in online documentation of
AUC @TeX{}.

@section Indentation and formatting

AUC @TeX{} may automatically indent your document as you write it. By
pressing @key{lfd} instead of @key{ret} at the end of a line, the
current line is indented by two spaces according to the current
environment level, and the cursor is moved down one line.  By pressing
@key{tab}, the current line is indented, and the cursor stays where it
is.  The well-known Emacs feature @code{format-paragraph} (@kbd{M-q}) is
reimplemented especially for AUC @TeX{} to follow the indentation.  A
special command @code{LaTeX-fill-buffer} lets you indent an entire
document like the well-known C utility indent (this time, only according
to the La@TeX{} structure @t{:-)}.

@section Completion

By studying your @samp{\documentclass} command (in the top of your
document), and consulting a precompiled list of (La)@TeX{} symbols from
a large number of @TeX{} and La@TeX{} files, AUC @TeX{} is aware of the
La@TeX{} commands you should be able to use in this particular document.
This `knowledge' of AUC @TeX{} is used for two purposes.

@enumerate
@item
To make you able to `complete' partly written La@TeX{} commands. You may
e.g. write @kbd{\renew} and press @kbd{M-@key{tab}}
(@code{TeX-complete-symbol}), and then AUC @TeX{} will complete the word
@samp{\renewcommand} for you. In case of ambiguity it will display a
list of possible completions.
@item
To aid you inserting environments, that is \begin - \end pairs. This is
done by pressing C-c C-e (La@TeX{}-environment), and you will be
prompted for which `environment' to insert.
@end enumerate

@section Editing your document

A number of more or less intelligent keyboard macros have been defined
to aid you editing your document.  The most important are listed below.

@table @code
@item LaTeX-environment
(@kbd{C-c C-e}) Insert a @samp{\begin@{@}} --- @samp{\end@{@}} pair as
described above.
@item LaTeX-section
(@kbd{C-c C-s}) Insert one of @samp{\chapter}, @samp{\section}, etc.
@item TeX-font
(@kbd{C-c C-f C-r}, @kbd{C-c C-f C-i}, @kbd{C-c C-f C-b}) Insert one of
@samp{\textrm@{ @}}), @samp{\textit@{ \/@}} @samp{\textbf@{ @}} etc.
@end table

A number of additional functions are available.  But it would be far too
much to write about here.  Refer to the rest of the AUC @TeX{}
documentation for further information.

@section Running La@TeX{}

When invoking one of the commands @code{TeX-command-master} (@kbd{C-c
C-c}) or @code{TeX-command-region} (@kbd{C-c C-r}) La@TeX{} is run on
either the entire current document or a given region of it.  The Emacs
view is split in two, and the output of @TeX{} is printed in the second
half of the screen, as you may simultaneously continue editing your
document.  In case @TeX{} find any errors when processing your input
you can call the function @code{TeX-next-error} (@kbd{C-c `}) which will
move the cursor to the first given error, and display a short
explanatory text along with the message @TeX{} gave.  This procedure may
be repeated until all errors have been displayed.  By pressing @kbd{C-c
C-w} (@code{TeX-toggle-debug-boxes}) you can toggle whether the browser
also should notify over-full/under-full boxes or not.

Once you've successfully formatted your document, you may preview or
print it by invoking @code{TeX-command-master} again.

@section Outlines

Along with AUC @TeX{} comes support for outline mode for Emacs, which
lets you browse the sectioning structure of your document, while you
will still be able to use the full power of the rest of the AUC @TeX{}
functionality.
