Subject: Undernet IRC protocol changes
Date: Sat, 3 Aug 1996 21:33:05 -0500

Hello there,

     This mail is being sent to all IRC client coders, announcing some
changes in the server-client protocol on the Undernet IRC network. An
RFC supplementing RFC1459 is in the works (it's unclear when this will
be released however). In the meanwhile, I'll try to update you with any
significant changes/features/bugs that affect clients.

1) the /list command.
======================

   The default action of the /list command (to list all channels) has
   been disabled since it was found to consume a lot of CPU on IRC
   servers (with hundreds of clients listing thousands of channels).
   Changes include a _required_ paramater to LIST. 

*** Usage on ircII:  /QUOTE LIST parameters
*** Where parameters is a space or comma seperated list of one or more of:
***  <max_users    ; Show all channels with less then max_users.
***  >min_users    ; Show all channels with more then min_users.
***  C<max_minutes ; Channels that exist less then max_minutes.
***  C>min_minutes ; Channels that exist more then min_minutes.
***  T<max_minutes ; Channels with a topic last set less then max_minutes
  ago.
***  T>min_minutes ; Channels with a topic last set more then min_minutes
  ago.
*** Example:  LIST <3,>1,C<10,T>0  ; 2 users, younger then 10 min., topic
  set.

   We suggest incorporating this change directly into your client so that
   a /quote is no longer needed (i.e. a direct message to the server).


2) PONG replies
================

   To counter source routing/ip-spoofing, Undernet IRC servers send a PING
   command to the client followed by a random key. The client is expected
   to respond with this key as a parameter to PONG. e.g.
     server -> client      PING :23472820203484
     client to server      PONG :23472820203484

   ircII and mirc are two clients that already follow this. I'm not sure
   about other clients.

3) Other Undernet changes
=========================
 
   A list of all Undernet server numerics are included in the server source.

   ftp://ftp.undernet.org/irc/servers/current

   Significant changes over the past few years, affecting clients, include: 
   /stats w replies, /stats g replies, /silence replies, channel topic 
   information replies, user signon time reply, channel
   creation time reply, etc. I've attached the file for your convenience.
   Please check if your client responds to these numeric replies. 

   I also suggest adding the /map and /silence commands to your clients 
   (/silence cuts off flooding at the server level: syntax: 
      /silence +user@host   or  /silence nick
   /silence -user@host     or  /silence -nick     to delete a silenced entry.
   /map returns the current routing map of irc servers).

   There's also a patch removing /away from the server (this functionality 
   belongs to the client) in its review stages. You may wish to implement 
   a mechanism that simulates /away on your client without using the server
   message, to prepare for this possible future change.

New versions
=============

    If you release new versions of your clients, please upload them to
    /incoming on ftp.undernet.org and drop me a note. I'll move them to 
    the correct location asap. We're mirrored on ftp2-4.undernet.org. I'd
    really appreciate it if you could take a moment and verify that the latest
    version of your client is out there. Thanks.
    

Feedback
========

    To stay in touch with Undernet IRC protocol changes / server code
    patches, you're welcome to join the Undernet coder committee mailing
    list. Simply drop  a mail to majordomo@undernet.org with 
    "subscribe coder-com" in the body.



			Thanks and if you have any other questions about
making your client Undernet compatible, please don't hesitate to mail
coder-com@undernet.org. Sincerely,


						Mandar Mirashi (Mmmm)

Attached are numeric.h    and the latest Undernet IRC server list (which
you may wish to include with your next client release - it is also available
at  http://www.comco.com/dougmc/irc-stats/server-lists    )

Note: Most Undernet IRC servers listen on ports 6661-6669.

      The alias us.undernet.org is a roundrobin that picks a US server at
      random (for first time users who aren't sure which server to connect to).
      The same applies to eu.undernet.org (europe). The use of the undernet.org
      alias over the actual hostname is highly recommended (when servers
      cease to exist, the alias will still function since we point it to
      a working server).

Subject: IRC client coders update
Date: Mon, 30 Sep 1996 13:42:25 -0500

Heya,

  Some other random thoughts that might apply to all IRC clients:

* Ports - It would be nice if client coders allow for the specification
  of alternate ports to automatically connect on, if the connect to
  the default port fails. Most servers listen to ports in the range
  6660-6669. It has grown incredibly difficult to connect on the
  default port 6667 on big servers.

* Extensions - As much as some may dislike it, I believe the next "wave"
  of chat clients to hit the net are those that include VRML/audio/video
  communication. There are several independent web sites or proprietary
  developers who provide this, but none of them are integrated into IRC
  clients. You may wish to investigate means of doing this with your clients.

* For those developing GUI clients, one idea would be to have an addressbook
  which includes name, associated GIF file, associated URL, etc. Then
  you could auto-attach a thumbnail gif to the nick, as it scrolls over
  a channel. The nick itself could be "clickable" if a URL field is
  specified, which would make your default browser jump to that location.

* irc-url spec - I haven't updated it for a while. It can be found at:
   ftp://ftp.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-mirashi-url-irc-01.txt
  and the mailing list can be subscribed to, by sending mail to 
  majordomo@wildstar.net with "subscribe irl-url" in the body.

* Nospoof patch - I hope everyone has updated their client (if it needed it)
  to work with the PING/PONG and other Undernet ircd changes I'd sent earlier. 

			That's all for now..thanks

This might be of interest to you. There's a discussion going and I'm
pretty sure that the list-maintainer (Lindsay) has an archive of all
mails going through the list.

Hi,

   I made reference today in my emails to a CTCP standards group.  This is
based from a number of client coders, and has turned into an email list and
an Internet Draft document (formerly called a Draft RFC).  The list is hosted
by Zircon author Lindsay Marshall.

   To join the list send "subscribe ctcp your name" to:

   listproc%catless@newcastle.ac.uk.

   If you want to see the current draft, you can send me a private email
message, or visit my company's web site at:

Heya,

    Here's some information re: the next upcoming release of the Undernet
server code - u2.10 (still in beta). Please mail coder-com@undernet.org
directly if you have any concerns. 

    The other thing I wanted to check was if you'd be interested in joining 
a mailing list open ONLY to client coders, to discuss client issues (the
"colour" issue being an egregious example). I'd be more than willing to
set one up. You can mail me at mandar@wildstar.net re: this.

Thanks

Mmmm

Subject: [C-Com] Server NOtice numerics

Hiya,

can someone asap pass this info to the client coders ?!!

A new numeric 249:

Example:

4.undernet.org 249 nick :Servernotice mask: 12287 (0x2fff)

Where the number 12287 is a bit-or-ed mask with the meaning:

#define SNO_OLDSNO      0x1     /* unsorted old messages */
#define SNO_SERVKILL    0x2     /* server kills (nick collisions) */
#define SNO_OPERKILL    0x4     /* oper kills */
#define SNO_HACK2       0x8     /* desyncs */
#define SNO_HACK3       0x10    /* temporary desyncs */
#define SNO_UNAUTH      0x20    /* unauthorized connections */
#define SNO_TCPCOMMON   0x40    /* common TCP or socket errors */
#define SNO_TOOMANY     0x80    /* too many connections */
#define SNO_HACK4       0x100   /* Uworld actions on channels */
#define SNO_GLINE       0x200   /* glines */
#define SNO_NETWORK     0x400   /* net join/break, etc */
#define SNO_IPMISMATCH  0x800   /* IP mismatches */
#define SNO_OLDREALOP   0x1000  /* old oper-only messages */
#define SNO_CONNEXIT    0x2000  /* client connect/exit (ugh) */

One can set this way a more specific filter for server notices:

/MODE nick +s 3847

Or add (set) an EXTRA bit:

/MODE nick +s 128

Note the extra numeric parameter (space seperated from the umodes).

This would also work:

/MODE mynick +iswd 853



/MODE nick -s 64

Unsets bits (/MODE nick -s 96  unsets both 64 and 32).

This will be added to undernet server version 2.10.
The new numeric will be returned every time you set a new mask, or
when you ask you umode with '/MODE nick' and the mask is unequal
the default mask. The default mask is unfortunately subject to
change, but currently 1540 (0x604).
Doing /MODE nick +s, will NOT give the 249 numeric, but set the
mask to the default mask.

Run

PS

If client coders absolutely want to know what the default mask is
I suggest they use this string: MODE <nick> +ss 2147483648
This currently gives (ircII):
--> MODE Run4 -s
*** Mode change "-s" for user Run4 by Run4
--> MODE Run4 +ss 2147483648
*** Mode change "+s" for user Run4 by Run4
249 Servernotice mask:  1540 (0x604)

PS2

Unofficial ;), one can also do: /MODE nick +s -4 , to uset bit '4',
and even /MODE nick -s -4, to SET bit '4'.

Well, first of all - BECAUSE the server isn't released and tested yet
this might change all a few times more :), so don't rush your implementation.

Most important changes ALREADY are:

- - There will be a NEW numeric (249 was already used I learned).
- - The trick with +ss <large number> will NOT work, you can use
  +ss +<large number> now (note the extra '+').

I see no problem in attaching the digits to the s.. thus:

/MODE Run +s29382

It just doesn't look as well... and users might type a space intuitively.
There is no problem with MY ircII (-2.8.2) client and multiple umode params...

We DID have a long discussion about this yes, because initially we wanted
to use server-notice-channels. But that sucks for multi-window clients like
mIRC (without patches), so we ended up by making a new user mode.
It seems likely that more then 31 server-notice-"channels" will be needed
yes, in which case a decimal number is bad thing to do.
I'm open for a quick discussion on a new interface.

Run

PS Please forward this to other client-coders again :)
   Is there a list of addresses I could use ?

| >One can set this way a more specific filter for server notices:
| 
| [user mode +s takes an argument now]
| 
| 
| Please note the importance of this:  This proposal would stipulate
| the first user mode that is to take an argument.  While this is not
| (neccesarily) against the spirit of modes, i would make an educated
| guess that ircII is not the only client in the world that optimizes
| its handling of user modes with the assumption that arguments are not
| present.
| 
| The reason why this is significant is not because of the specific use
| of the argument, but rather that current clients will have to be retro
| fitted with code that will be able to handle arguments on user modes,
| and the fact that since you are overloading a current user mode, you
| are introducing a gratuitous incompatability which makes the job of a
| client coder all that much harder becuase now ill have to special case
| the undernet 2.10 server for this exceptional behavior.  It is very fair
| to say that this is <not> an insignificant change.
| 
| While i will probably support this before its all said and done, I want
| to make sure that I tell you that I HOPE you thought about this and ruled
| out all other reasonable solutions other than having user modes take
| arguments.  I dont expect this to change, and thats the way it is:
| I do appreciate your giving far advance notice instead of just releasing
| the code and then griping that current clients dont support it correctly.
| (ala efnet 2.9)
| 
| This will certainly not be supported or retrofitted on any already
| released EPIC client (eg, epic3), but probably will eventually be supported
| in the EPIC4 development cycle.  I cannot give you any assurances when.
| Please re-assure me that you will always have less than 32 flags for this
| new user mode.
