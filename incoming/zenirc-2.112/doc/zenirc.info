Waste time on IRC using ZenIRC

With ZenIRC you can connect to IRC servers and waste time.  ZenIRC runs
under Emacs-18, Emacs-19, Epoch and Xemacs.  This manual describes
ZenIRC version 3.0.

Introduction
************



If ZenIRC is installed properly, starting ZenIRC without any extensions
is fairly easy--you just type `M-x zenirc' in your Emacs.

If ZenIRC isn't installed at all, you probably won't be able to read
this manual. Turn to the "INSTALL" file which comes with the
distribution of ZenIRC-3.0.

If ZenIRC is installed but you still can't start it, there's a big
chance that you can't connect to the default server.

Finding an IRC server and connecting to it.
===========================================



There's only one default server for ZenIRC, irc.stealth.net. This server
might, of course, be down or unreachable. If this is so, you need to
connect to another server for ZenIRC to work.

ZenIRC comes with a list of servers maintained by Doug McLaren. The list
is from 1996-04-15 so it might not be correct. This list is posted to
the Usenet group alt.irc and alt.irc.questions twice a month and a copy
of it can be found via anonymous FTP at
 ftp.comco.com:/pub/irc/server-list-current

Changing default server (and attributes).
-----------------------------------------



There's three different ways to change your default server. They're
listed below in the prefered order. If you use example 1.1.1.1 or
1.1.1.2 you'll get some redundancy example 1.1.1.3 can't give you.
1.1.1.3 is good if you want to start right away and set things up later
on in life.

* Using ordinary variables.::   



File: zenirc.info, Node: The $IRCSERVER way., Next: The zenirc-server-alist way., Prev: Changing default server (and attributes)., Up: Changing default server (and attributes).

The $IRCSERVER way.
...................



By setting your environment variable $IRCSERVER you also change the
default servers for most other IRC clients around. How to set this
variable is different in different shells.

	sh, bash, zsh; IRCSERVER="some.server";export IRCSERVER
	csh, tcsh; setenv IRCSERVER "some.server"

ZenIRC uses this variable just like ircII. The correct syntax is;

	server1[:port1[:password1[:nickname1[:username1]]]]
server2[:port2...

To set your default server to irc.stealth.net with the nickname `ben'
and your secondary server to irc.funet.fi on port 6666 with the nickname
Vesa you would set $IRCSERVER to;

	irc.stealth.net:::ben: irc.funet.fi:6666::Vesa:

The zenirc-server-alist way.
............................



By setting the ZenIRC variable zenirc-server-alist you can do the same
thing as with $IRCSERVER, this way you won't have the same defaults for
other clients though.

To do exactly as the example in 1.1.1.1, you should set
zenirc-server-alist as follows;

     	(setq zenirc-server-alist 
     	  '(("irc.stealth.net" nil nil "ben" nil)
     	    ("irc.funet.fi" 6666 nil "Vesa" nil)))

	


File: zenirc.info, Node: Using ordinary variables., Prev: The zenirc-server-alist way., Up: Changing default server (and attributes).

Using ordinary variables.
.........................



The only thing you actually _need_ to set is zenirc-server-default.

To set your default server, use zenirc-server-default;

     	(setq zenirc-server-default "irc.stealth.net")

To set your default nickname, use zenric-nick-default;

     	(setq zenirc-nick-default "ben")

To set your default password, use zenric-password-default;

     	(setq zenirc-password-default "mostly not used")

To set your default port, use zenirc-port-default;

     	(setq zenirc-port-default 6667)

To set your default username, use zenirc-user-login-name-default;
	
     	(setq zenirc-user-login-name-default "oedipus rpc.rexd")

Those servers are all down.
---------------------------



If you don't want to restart Emacs and ZenIRC to try a new server, type
`M-x zenirc-select' and you will be asked a few questions.




File: zenirc.info, Node: The server doesn't let me on?!, Prev: Those servers are all down., Up: Finding an IRC server and connecting to it.

The server doesn't let me on?!
------------------------------



The IRC administrators might not want people from everywhere to connect
to his server. I'd recomend you to use an as closeby server as
possible. The list of servers lists the server by country, the best shot
would be to use one as close to you as possible.

There's also a possiblity that the admin has banned your domain. If this
is true, talk to your system administrator about it.

Some servers won't let you connect if your system isn't running an IDENT
service. This breaks the RFC for IDENT so be sure to tell the
administrator of the server about this idiocy, then go on and pick a
better server.

Using ZenIRC to waste time.
***************************



Once you've conected to a server, Emacs will enter ZenIRC
major-mode. This mode parses information from the server and shows it to
you in different ways, it also give you a nice interface to send things
to the server. ZenIRCs major-mode also understands CTCP and parts of the
DCC protocol.

What goes on in the background?	
================================



Lots of things. If you don't know much elisp and just want to use the
client you couldn't be less bothered actually. If you really are
interested in the internals of ZenIRC you should join one or more of the
ZenIRC mailinglists, read the source and play around a little.  Changing
small things and adding some small nifty hooks are pretty trivial
though, read more about that in SECTION and SECTION.

Communicating with the server.
------------------------------



Sending stuff to the server is done by hitting return (^M). ZenIRC
parses the things you send to the server in two different ways,
depending on the first character you type. With a leading "/" (you can
change this by setting zenirc-commandchar) ZenIRC parses your line as a
command. Without the leading "/" ZenIRC sends your line as a message to
your current victim, this is done with PRIVMSG as described in RFC1459.

Example, if the channel #se-opers is your zenric-current-victim and you
type;

     	Hello people^M

the clients on channel #se-opers will see your message. Use the /query
command to change zenirc-current-victim. :LINK:

On the other hand, if you type;

     	/part #se-opers^M

you will part the channel. Look in 2.2 for an extensive list of all
commands and how to use them.




File: zenirc.info, Node: Server communicating with you., Prev: Communicating with the server., Up: What goes on in the background?	

Server communicating with you.
------------------------------


ZenIRC parses all the information the servers sends to you in one way or
the other. On a few occasions ZenIRC might lack the information on how
to parse a certain thing, this is almost considered a bug (use M-x
zenirc-bug to report this behaviour).

To display the information, ZenIRC uses language catalogs. The default
catalog is English, but this can be changed easily. Writing your own
catalog is trivial and we'd love you if you wrote your own catalog and
mailed it in to the developers.

There's a lot of different variables you can change, and hooks to play
with if you feel adventureous. You can, for example, ignore people, make
ZenIRC beep when something special happens, have timestamps on special
messages and so forth. The variables are described in SECTION and the
hooks are described in SECTION.

`zenirc.el' only contains the most important features, some very nice
features are placed in their own files. `zenirc-fill.el', for example,
fills certain messages for you so Emacs doesn't have to wrap long lines
in an ugly way. Read more about scripts in SECTION.

Commands in ZenIRC major-mode.
==============================



As already described, ZenIRC pareses lines with a leading "/" as a
command. Most of the commands are sent right off to the server, some
commands are ZenIRC specific though.

Keybindings in ZenIRC major-mode.
=================================



Hitting certain key combinations in ZenIRC will result in ZenIRC doing
stuff you didn't think it would. This is really nifty, when you realize
what actually happens HELLO PER

	2.3.1


	Hitting return ("\n" or "^M") will send the current line to the
server. If you're looking through the backlog and hit return, ZenIRC
will throw you to the end of the buffer.

Hitting ; or : at the beginning of the line will help you while
communicating to others then your zenirc-current-victim. For example;

     /msg omnion meep
     /msg ace95 meep
     *Omnion* meep meep

Hitting ";" now will result in ZenIRC adding "/msg ace95 " at the
beginning of the line.  Hitting ":" will result in ZenIRC adding "/msg
omnion " at the beginning of the line.

By using a few of the scripts which comes with ZenIRC you can get
tab-completion and a shell like history feature, more about that in
SECTION.
