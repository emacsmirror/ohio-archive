1   what is irc ?

irc sucks.  irc is reputed to stand for 'internet relay chat',
but it really means 'i repeat class'.  though some people say
it means 'Irc Really suCks' [capitals only for emphasis].


2   why does irc suck ?

because piker and dl are irc operators.


3   why should i irc ?

to be rude to irc operators, particularly dl and piker.


4   what is netsex ?

netsex is a myth.  a long time ago an irc operator called
wumpus (it rhymes with wimp, sorta) made up a story that
it wandered on to channel -69 to find people engaging in
what it called 'netsex', but this was never proven.  since
then people have just been being rude to wumpus for being
so silly about this 'netsex'


5   should i have netsex ?

d'oh!  only stupid people who read this question if they
knew what netsex is (see number 4).


6   how do i get on irc ?

take my advice - don't.


7   what is a channel operator ?

a major fascist (see number 10).


8   what is an irc operator ?

a major dweeb (see number 9).


9   what is a major dweeb ?

an irc operator (see number 8).


10  what is a major fascist ?

an channel operator (see number 7).


11  what is a bot ?

a penis extension.  only this penis extension doesn't impresss
the girlies (or the boys, if you/they are so inclinded [*]).

[*] if you are sexually offended by this, then you lose.


12  what is the piglet way ?

ojnk.


13  what is a penis extension ?

a bot (see number 11).



14  how do i become of the piglet way ?

ojnk.


15  does linux suck ?

yes. [*]

[*] if you are sexually offended by this, then you lose.


16  what is irc like ?

learn by example:

Adam Pops My Cherry.

A True Story of the IRC
by Ben Mesander
ben@hopper.acs.virginia.edu
(irc - piglet2)

So one night, Leftist, and I (piglet2) on IRC decide to see what it's
like to be hot and willing IRC babes. Leftist becomes Julie, I become
Samantha, and we cruise the #hotsex channel, looking for a little
action. Julie plays smart, beautiful and passionate... I play dumb with
big tits (this is more natural for me). An interesting phenomenon arose
- while I  originally was the one that attracted our target, Adam, he
soon liked Julie better than I. Brains over tits, I guess. In addition,
there is a little dialogue with catfish, a friend of ours who borrowed
my nick and wreaked havoc on several channels (she was through by the
time this log was started). I wish I had the presence of mind to log
the whole thing. Well I didn't. But to give the story so far, Adam has
revealed that he has slept with seven women, all of them "nearly
virgins." He's a college senior in Communications with a 2.0 gpa. Then
I insisted that he tell me a bedtime story. 

What follows is the logfile. Absolute stark naked reality on IRC. This 
is Adam's story, the story of the average college student who's looking
for a net.fuck on irc.

<Adam> then up the top of your foot
<Adam> to the inside of your left leg
<Julie> OOH!
<Adam> to the knee
-> *catfish* it is so funny.
<Adam> up to the thigh
<Adam> still slowly and softly brushing inside
=> =Julie= she does? why?
=Julie= Dunno.
<Adam> up above your glistening vagina
<Adam> kissing across your abdomen
=Julie= *Adam* just remember, julie that I don't lie about this stuff.
<Adam> and coming back down the other thigh's inside
<Adam> then down the inside....down the foot...
<Adam> to the toesies
<Adam> kissing each and every one of them
<Adam> down from the big one to the little baby
=Julie= Adam's got bad sentence structure.  Let's make his life miserable.
<Adam> then up the outside of your right leg...
=> =Julie= tell him you think kissing toes is gross.
<Adam> over your knee
*Catfish* piggie, you better be saving some of this :)
<Adam> to the hip
<Adam> up your chest
<Adam> to your breast
<Adam> over it ever so gently
=Julie= No.  That's in character for you, not me.
=> =Julie= or maybe that you have a club foot.
*** Action: Adam pauses for a breather...
<Samantha> whew!
<Adam> up to the right side of your neck
<Adam> then to your right earlobe
<Adam> tugging at it with my teeth
<Samantha> mmmm!
<Adam> then across your neck to your left one (my fave)
<Samantha> I like that!
<Adam> then back around to the back of your neck
<Adam> now, I place my hands firmly but gently on your shoulders
<Adam> squeezing them a little
<Adam> your arms are spread out above your head
=Julie= This guy is probably a 45 second-er.
<Adam> (like you're doing jumping jacks)
<Samantha> mmmm.
<Samantha> and what is julie doing during all this??
<Julie> Masturbating, actually.
<Adam> then I run my hands down the sides of your back GENTLY as I SLOWLY AND
+GENTLY go down your spine with my lips
<Samantha> ooh. I can feel myself stretched out!
=Julie= Hahaha, he likes me better.
=> =Julie= you slut. i bet you 10 net.bucks youre wrong.
<Adam> then I go to your left "cheek"
<Adam> and go down the back of your leg, outside
=Julie= *Adam* I have a DEEP voice.  Very sexy voice I'm told.  Women love
+it.
<Samantha> Squeal!
<Adam> down to the foot
=Julie= He's offering to do it to me on the phone later.
=> =Julie= you win. he's not msging me. but I'm loggin this for planet
+yip.
=Julie= Tee-hee.
<Julie> I'm excited.  I'm gonna masturbate with my fingers now.
<Adam> down the sole of your foot
<Adam> to the little toesies
<Adam> kissing every one of them
=> =Julie= have you ever anally masturbated? tee hee! Lemme find joN's
+phone number, kay?
=Julie= -> *adam* Yes.  The kbord is getting sticky.
=Julie= No.  K.
=> =Julie= (804)977-8802
<Adam> then back up to the inside of your leg...back of your knee (which you
+would probably kick at this point)
<Adam> up to your ass
<Samantha> mmm.
<Adam> cross over to the other side
<Adam> then down the leg
<Adam> to the back of the knee
<Adam> to the sole of the foot
<Adam> to the toesies
*** Adam is adam@rac3.wam.umd.edu (Adam L. Greenberg)
*** on channels: @#nights 
*** on irc via server tjeeves.acc.Virginia.EDU (Jefferson Server, UVa)
<Adam> kissing each one
<Adam> then back up the outside of the leg...
=Julie= What should I do with joN's number?
<Adam> hmm now where?
=> =Julie= this guy is a foot fetishist.
<Adam> then back to the right ear
=> =Julie= say it is your number.
=Julie= Ok.
<Adam> I lower myself onto you and pull a blanket over us to keep us warm
<Adam> As I lie on top of you, nibbling your ear and massaging your shoulders,
+you feel me sticking into your lower back
=> =Julie= I feel like doing a dieter. "Suddenly, you have become
+tiresome."
<Adam> Finally I cannot resist
=Julie= HE cannot resist!
<Adam> You slowly spread your legs and I enter you from behind, lying on top
+of you, spreading your arms out and holding you down to the bed.
<Samantha> I like that!
<Samantha> ooh. I'm so wet!
<Adam> You feel me sliding inside of you and you begin to moan
=Julie= 3.5 hrs till Calc.
*Adam* how do I know that?
<Julie> Masturbate, sam, it works.
-> *adam* know what?
*Adam* what?
=Julie= *Adam* I hope I'm making you happy :-)
-> *adam* you asked me how i know that.
*Adam* how do I know you're really wet and not just saying that, samantha?
=Julie= -> *adam* HOPELESSLY
<Adam> I go in and out and in and out.
-> *adam* hmm. you'll have to trust me on this! this is a great bedtime story,
+you know I needed something like this.
-> *adam* i can't wait to meet you!
<Adam> We both get up on our knees and I grab your thighs and hold your sweet
+ass against the front of my legs
<Julie> mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<Samantha> Julie's getting off!
<Adam> As I slowly pump you, you get up on all fours...
<Samantha> I'd love to lick you julie!
<Julie> oooooh if you only could
<Samantha> with adam too. friday?
<Adam> Our bodies don't disconnect but my dick just goes in and out of you
+rhythmically.
-> *catfish* I'm saving this to a logfile.
<Julie> if (from "HailOtis@socspy.sci.fau.edu") then save /tmp/clc/priv/purps
<Adam> then I reach around and play with your clit
<Samantha> mmmm...
=Julie= I have to piss.  Bad.  Cover for me.
*Catfish* bless you boy!
=> =Julie= tell im you have to go " finish" yourself.
-> *adam* julie just told me she has to go "finish" herself!
<Adam> Honey, you have to remember that I like making LOVE not fucking...so
+this is gonna be slow slow slow
<Adam> I reach around, lower my chest onto your back as you still stay on all
+fours...
<Adam> fingering your hot wet hole
-> *catfish* he appears to have a thing for young girls, feet, and humping on
+all fours.
<Adam> every time I touch your clit your hips buck and you feel the tension
+building
-> *catfish* I guess pretty normal for an irc geek.
<Samantha> I'm buckin honey.
*Catfish* how I wish to see this!
=Julie= *Adam* yeah my hands are beginning to shake
-> *catfish* hee hee. I'm catching about half of it in a logfile.
=Julie= I wonder why.
<Adam> then I just ram you one time so smoothly that you scream in pleasure as
+you feel your pussy grabbing me tighter and tighter
=> =Julie= catfish sure acts interested in it!
<Adam> pulsing around me
<Adam> and it feels good.
=Julie= She wants you.
*Catfish* get as much as possible.
<Adam> with that, I shoot very warmly inside you...
=> =Julie= 10 net.bucks sez she don't.
=Julie= I like how not only does he tell us what he does, he tells us what
+we do.
<Adam> we have both worked (all worked) up a sweat
<Adam> and lie down in the bed together
<Samantha> whew!
<Samantha> oh honey, I can't wait!
<Samantha> Julie, I'm gonna go fix your car!
=Julie= 10 net.bucks sez she likes computer people.
=> =Julie= puleez - i hate comptuer people.
<Adam> ain't done yet!
<Samantha> Well hon, I am pretty done.
=Julie= Some people find us mystifying.
<Samantha> And I got to go to work tomorrow!
<Adam> oh I hope not
<Samantha> More on friday, but for real?
<Adam> first a little nap
<Adam> then a shower
<Samantha> Don't worry adam, I just need to be rested up four our little party!
<Samantha> I don't have a phone right now, do you have julie's number?
*** Action: Adam gets a funny feeling he'll never hear from you guys
=Julie= -> *ADAM* WHEN?  I WILL CALL WHENEVER!  But i have to go to bed
+soon.
<Samantha> Friday?
<Adam> I have no LD remember?
<Samantha> Friday night?
<Adam> They won't put it on until....no friday is NO GOOD!
<Samantha> well, if u can call julie on a pay phone? Satruday?
<Julie> Sam, I will call him.
<Samantha> julie can pick me up, in her car.
<Samantha> julie is at 804 977 8802
<Adam> My LD will be on soon...jeez, let's not rush this all!  I'm a little
+nervous...besides. I
<Julie> Sam I wanna lick your wetness.
<Samantha> julie i miss you *hugs*
=Julie= What do you think joN will think?
=> =Julie= I'll leave him email...
<Adam> I'd rather wait until A) I have a haircut! and b) I can take you ladies
+out for at least a nice dinner!
<Adam> I want to make a good first impression
<Julie> ADAM, I don't care about dinner OR hair now!
<Samantha> But julie is a hairdresser! she can cut your hair!
<Julie> I only care about feeling your hard cock inside of me.
<Samantha> I'm so hot tonight.
=Julie= You're "officially" calling me right after this.  So I can avoid
+calling Adam.
-> *catfish* oh lordie help me.
<Adam> Well, we're gonna have to have quite a bit of foreplay first because I
+haven't had any in a long time so I'd probably come pretty quickly.  But get
+me to come two or three times and after that I'll last quite a while,
+actually.
=> =Julie= just tell him you can't afford the ld right now either.
<Adam> The last girl I made love to had to have me stop after about an hour
+she was in pain
=Julie= Too late, babe.
<Julie> It takes me WAY longer than that.
=> =Julie= a precummer.
<Samantha> me too!
<Adam> Not when you're with me it won't
=Julie= _adam?
<Samantha> remember you have to please two of us!
<Julie> PROMISE?
<Samantha> and we can help eachi other out a little too...
<Adam> My fingers can make you come in about 5...I'll guarantee it or double
+your fingering back!
<Samantha> ooh! I love that!
<Adam> My voice plays a key role here, too
<Julie> yum
=> =Julie= "my voice. gag"
=Julie= I'm so moist.  This is all being logged?
=> =Julie= u bet.
=Julie= from where?
<Samantha> well goodnight! I have to go!
=> =Julie= on my amiga at home.
<Adam> hey not so fast!
<Samantha> mmm, adma, can I give you a kiss?
=Julie= I mean, where did you start?  Do selective editing and send it in.
<Adam> oh honey you can give me whatever you want
<Samantha> *hugs* julie!
<Samantha> oh adam, we will have fun! but I have to work tomorrow! look at the tiem!
<Samantha> bye!

I'd never had net.sex before. Adam devirginified another babe, and my
net.cherry is forever lost. I'm checking into the Betty Ford clinic.

<fletcher> any one here know anything about vax?
<piglet3> a vacuum cleaner?
<fletcher> i want to know how to make a plan available to people who finger me on irc
<fletcher> anyone?
<ckd> Well, is it running VMS, Ultrix, BSD, or what?
<fletcher> hmm
<fletcher> is that to me?
<fletcher> i think vms
<fletcher> i am pretty sure...
<fletcher> so any ideas?
<fletcher> i would like to have something available to people who finger me
<piglet3> wear a crotchless panty.
<fletcher> funny....
<poxaV> ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
<bpk> haha
<poxaV> you mean a .plan file.
<fletcher> yes!
<fletcher> hmm.. brb... hmm...
<Daemon> Pox: you see the usend and urecv posted on comp.sys.hp48?
<fletcher> brb
<poxaV> oh.. the _new_ IR sender?
<poxaV> how fast can it go?
<poxaV> IRSERV can go at 7600 baud or so.
<Daemon> pox: more than twice as fast as two HP's connected together via wire.
<poxaV> DAMN!
<poxaV> no way!
<Daemon> The've got some test results.. If they're accurate it's DAMN fast.
<fletcher> creating a .plan file did not create a plan for others to see... any suggestions?
<piglet3> heh.
<Daemon> PACMAN directory from goodies disk #7, 8308.5 bytes.
<Daemon> program used          SEND       TSEND (v2.0)    USEND

<Daemon>        23.456         6.252
<poxaV> holy COW...
<Daemon> yah..
<fletcher> well thanks anyway....
<poxaV> fletcher: SET PROT:W:RE
<poxaV> fletcher: SET PROT:W:RE .PLAN
<fletcher> ok whree do i do this?
<poxaV> from your login directory.
<Daemon> 289bytes/sec.
<fletcher> ok then what?
<poxaV> THEN test it again.
<poxaV> it's hard to say if that will do it, since i have no idea what TCP/IP software your VMS machine has.
<poxaV> oh, *AND* a crotchless panty.
<fletcher> ok.. hold on.. it said i didnt have a .plan file... brb.. thanks...
<piglet3> hee hee.
<fletcher> m ric hold on...
<fletcher> hmm..
<fletcher> ok it accepted it fine.. only when i put in the whole name of the file though.. which i called irc.plan
<fletcher> would someone finger me and tell me what my plan says?
<fletcher> when i did it from another account it didnt work
<piglet3> TAMU has a fucked up fingerd, I think. sigh.
<fletcher> still said no plan
<piglet3> I think I remember that.
<fletcher> i think so
<fletcher> hmm
<poxaV> well, *don't* call it irc.plan.
<poxaV> call it ".plan", which is what the finger software *looks* for.
<piglet3> connect: Connection timed out
<Silek> make sure your $HOME can be read from the outside..
<poxaV> tamu's fingerd is fascist.
<poxaV> silek: this is VMS, not unix.
<piglet3> I can't finger him at all.
<poxaV> i doubt that anyone not at tamu.edu can.
<fletcher> yea it works fine for anyone here
<fletcher> i have just started giving out another accounts password so that they can finger me
<fletcher> hehhee
<fletcher> hmm.. let me try to just call it plan....
<piglet3> please don't tell me this. It reminds me of how lame my users are.
<poxaV> well, since that's what fingerd *looks* for, it *would* be a good idea.
<ckd> pox- see if finger @fascistbox.tamu.edu@unixbox.tamu.edu works
<fletcher> ok now what do i type again?
<fletcher> i created a .plan file
<poxaV> ckd: it don't, i'm pretty sure. they've either rewritten it, or put a filter on it... it's VERY fascist.
<poxaV> SET PROT:W:RE .plan
<fletcher> ok.. brb
<poxaV> SET PROT:W:RE SYS$LOGIN:.plan
<poxaV> lamer.
<bpk> HAHAHA
<poxaV> hopefully, he put the .plan file in his root directory already.
<poxaV> > finger FDP4175@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU@tamsun.tamu.edu
<poxaV> [tamsun.tamu.edu]
<bpk> I was once helping a guy set up a .plan file and it turned out all along he was doing a /ctcp finger on himself to test it.  *sigh*
<poxaV> 501:No matches to your query.
<poxaV> geezz
<piglet3> He gives out an account and  password so that people can finger him.
<poxaV> yeah. pretty good luser, mm?
<piglet3> That story gets saved.
<morkeleb> "here is my root password. now you can login and finger me ! oh and rape my machine too .."
<poxaV> "... and none of that icky lubricant stuff, either!"
<bpk> hahha
<poxaV> i used to have an account inside their gateway, so it'd work... but alas, the machine is gone.
<fletcher> *sigh*
<fletcher> fuck me!
<fletcher> i swear
<poxaV> no thanks.
<piglet3> no.
<fletcher> hmmm
<bpk> no thanks
