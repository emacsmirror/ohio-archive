1) Run `./configure' in the same directory as this file.

2) Check Makefile in the same directory as this file to make sure it
   says what you want.

3) Run `make install' in the same directory as this file.

4) If you don't install ZenIRC in the system directories you need to add
   an entry to your "load-path", preferably in your ~/.emacs file;

   (setq load-path (cons 
                    (expand-file-name "/full/path/to/zenirc/directory") 
                    load-path))

5) Read src/zenirc-example.el for instructions on how to set up ZenIRC
   for daily abuse.

To try it out--run `emacs', M-x load-library zenirc, M-x zenirc, Waste Time.
If this doesn't work, e-mail your problems to `zenirc-bug@splode.com'.
