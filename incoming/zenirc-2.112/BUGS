ZenIRC BUGS list -- Last updated 1996-04-25

* The server parsing code does strange things when it gets lots of
  action at the same time.

  Noah Friedman's comments to this 'bug'; 

  No, it's probably because the process filter isn't reentrant, and it
  wasn't intended to be. (It uses a global vector to reduce memory
  consumption). I've never observed that behavior, and I don't know
  how it can happen---the only time the server parser can be called
  recursively is if you are in the debugger or you send back a
  response through a process that has a pty.  But that's only
  significant it is gets run from a server hook, since only those get
  called from within the process filter.

  You could fix that at the expense of considerably greater consing.

* ISON is limited to 512 characters, make sure ZenIRC groks that.

* ZenIRC doesn't parse the following numerics at all, some of them aren't
  used by either 2.8 nor 2.9. Some other ugly servers use other numerics
  for other stuff as well.
