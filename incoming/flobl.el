;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put the file flobl.el in a directory in your load-path.  Byte
;; compile it.  Put the following in your .emacs (or site-start.el or
;; default.el):
;;
;;              (require 'flobl)
;;
;; It does not make sense to autoload this file.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; When working with several frames, I was always annoyed that
;; switch-to-buffer commands from frame A interfered with the ordering
;; of the buffers when doing C-x C-b in frame B.  To see this, start
;; Emacs, then create a buffer (C-x b aaa RET).  Then, create a new
;; frame and create two new buffers from the second frame (C-x b bbb
;; RET, then C-x b ccc RET).  Now, go back to the first frame and do
;; C-x C-b.  I wanted Emacs to show the *scratch* buffer and aaa as
;; the top two buffers, but the buffers bbb and ccc get in between.
;;
;; This little package solves this problem.
;;
;; This package doesn't change the behavior of the other-buffer
;; function.  This means that the default buffer offered when you do
;; C-x b (switch-to-buffer) doesn't change.  This behavior was `wrong'
;; with Emacs 19 and has been `corrected' for Emacs 20.  It is not
;; possible to fix this for Emacs 19 without hacking the C code.
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;; - Deal with bury-buffer correctly.  (This means to put the buffer
;;   at the bottom of the list, right?)
