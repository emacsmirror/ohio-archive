Release Announcement
CC Mode Version 5.26
Barry A. Warsaw and Martin Stjernholm
<mailto:bug-cc-mode@gnu.org>

This message announces the availability of a new version of CC Mode, a
GNU Emacs mode for editing C (ANSI and K&R), C++, Objective-C, Java,
CORBA's IDL, and Pike code.

As of this version Barry Warsaw steps down as the primary CC Mode
maintainer to be able to spend more time with family, other projects,
and his basses. ;)  There will be no changes in the agenda for CC Mode
as a whole; same old GPL license, web site and bug report address.
Many thanks to Barry for his commitment during the past years that
made CC Mode the indispensable tool it is.
