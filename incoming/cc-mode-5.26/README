INTRODUCTION

    The canonical Web location for all knowledge CC Mode is:

	<http://www.python.org/emacs/cc-mode/>

    Please read the cc-mode.texi manual for details on using CC Mode.
    This is available on-line from:

        <http://www.python.org/emacs/cc-mode/cc-mode-html/Top.html>

    As of this writing (22-Nov-1999), CC Mode version 5 currently
    works out of the box with XEmacs versions 19.15, 19.16, 20.3,
    20.4, 21.0, 21.1, and 21.2, and with Emacs versions 19.34, 20.2,
    20.3, and 20.4.

MORE INFORMATION

    NOTE: Since there are now multiple maintainers of CC Mode, you
    MUST address all correspondence to bug-cc-mode@gnu.org (or
    cc-mode-help@python.org, but that address is being phased out).

    Check out the CC Mode Web site for the latest information,
    updates, tips, installation and compatibility notes, etc. on using
    CC Mode.  The installation instructions given below are an excerpt
    of the on-line instructions.  If you have problems installing CC
    Mode, please check out the URL above before submitting a bug
    report.  Thanks!

    The MANIFEST file contains a description of all the files you
    should have gotten with this distribution.

MANUALS

    Preformatted versions of the manual in DVI, PostScript, and Info,
    are all available at the CC Mode Web page.

    To build the manual yourself, you will need the latest Texinfo
    release (as of this writing, Texinfo 3.11).  Specifically, you
    must make sure that your are using at least version 2.185 of the
    texinfo.tex file.  To build the Info manual, simply type:

        % makeinfo cc-mode.texi

    To make the DVI version, simply type:

        % texi2dvi cc-mode.texi

    Note that I've heard of other package releases that purport to
    include a texinfo.tex file newer than 2.185, but these don't
    support the @macro{} command.  If you have problems building the
    manuals, pick up a pre-built version.

INSTALLATION

    Here is a quick guide for installing CC Mode.  For the latest
    information on installing CC Mode, including compatibility notes
    for the various flavors of Emacs, please see the CC Mode Web site
    given above.

  Setting load-path

    You need to make sure that this new version of CC Mode is on your
    load-path, before any version that is distributed with your
    X/Emacs.  Note that the CC Mode distribution unpacks into its own
    subdirectory.  You can use this test to see which version of CC
    Mode your X/Emacs finds first:

        M-x locate-library RET cc-mode RET
                                 
    Make sure this finds the one you expect.  If not, you can add this
    to your .emacs file:

        (setq load-path (cons "/dir/of/cc-mode/" load-path))
                                 
    The path you use should be an absolute path (starting with a
    slash).  You cannot use a path beginning with "~" in the load-path
    variable.

  Byte Compiling

    It is highly recommended that you byte-compile CC Mode, for both
    performance and compatibility reasons.  Running CC Mode
    un-bytecompiled is not supported and may not work at all depending
    on the flavor of X/Emacs you are using.

    To compile CC Mode, do the following from your shell:

        % cd /path/to/cc-mode
        % $(EMACS) -batch -no-site-file -q -l cc-make.el cc-*.el

    where $(EMACS) is either emacs or xemacs depending on the flavor
    you use.

    You can safely ignore any byte compiler warnings; they are due to
    the cross X/Emacsen support.

    Note: It is important that CC Mode is byte compiled in the correct
    way.  Avoid compiling from inside an X/Emacs session, since that
    can produce incorrect byte code files that will generate strange
    errors later during normal use.

    Be sure to see the list of compatibility issues (in the CC Mode
    canonical Web pages -- see above), for special notes about X/Emacs
    versions and package interactions.

    To test that you have things set up correctly, visit a C file and
    then type:

        M-x c-version RET
        => Using CC Mode version 5.XX

    where XX is the correct minor revision number.
