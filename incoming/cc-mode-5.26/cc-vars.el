(defcustom c-offsets-alist nil
  "Association list of syntactic element symbols and indentation offsets.
As described below, each cons cell in this list has the form:

    (SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL . OFFSET)

When a line is indented, CC Mode first determines the syntactic
context of it by generating a list of symbols called syntactic
elements.  This list can contain more than one syntactic element and
the global variable `c-syntactic-context' contains the context list
for the line being indented.  Each element in this list is actually a
cons cell of the syntactic symbol and a buffer position.  This buffer
position is called the relative indent point for the line.  Some
syntactic symbols may not have a relative indent point associated with
them.

After the syntactic context list for a line is generated, CC Mode
calculates the absolute indentation for the line by looking at each
syntactic element in the list.  It compares the syntactic element
against the SYNTACTIC-SYMBOL's in `c-offsets-alist'.  When it finds a
match, it adds the OFFSET to the column of the relative indent point.
The sum of this calculation for each element in the syntactic list is
the absolute offset for line being indented.

If the syntactic element does not match any in the `c-offsets-alist',
an error is generated if `c-strict-syntax-p' is non-nil, otherwise the
element is ignored.

Actually, OFFSET can be an integer, a function, a variable, or one of
the following symbols: `+', `-', `++', `--', `*', or `/'.  These
latter designate positive or negative multiples of `c-basic-offset',
respectively: 1, -1, 2, -2, 0.5, and -0.5.  If OFFSET is a function,
it is called with a single argument containing the cons of the
syntactic element symbol and the relative indent point.  The function
should return an integer offset or nil if it can't decide.

OFFSET can also be a list, in which case it is recursively evaluated
using the semantics described above.  The first element of the list to 
return a non-nil value succeeds.  If none of the elements returns a
non-nil value, then what happends depends on the value of
`c-strict-syntax-p'.  When `c-strict-syntax-p' is nil, then an offset
of zero is used, otherwise an error is generated.

`c-offsets-alist' is a style variable.  This means that the offsets on
this variable are normally taken from the style system in CC Mode
\(see `c-default-style' and `c-styles-alist').  However, any offsets
put explicitly on this list will override the style system when a CC
Mode buffer is initialized \(there is a variable
`c-old-style-variable-behavior' that changes this, though).

Here is the current list of valid syntactic element symbols:
