;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Every effort has been made to improve the performance of
;; cc-mode. However, due to the nature of the C, C++, and Objective-C
;; language definitions, a trade-off is often required between
;; accuracy of construct recognition and speed. I believe it is always
;; best to be correct, and that the mode is currently fast enough for
;; most normal usage.  Others disagree.  I have no intention of
;; including these hacks in the main distribution.  When cc-mode
;; version 5 comes out, it will include a rewritten indentation engine
;; so that performance will be greatly improved automatically.  This
;; was not included in this release of version 4 so that Emacs 18
;; could still be supported.  Note that this implies that cc-mode
;; version 5 will *not* work on Emacs 18!
;;
;; To use, see the variable cc-lobotomy-pith-list and the function
;; cc-lobotomize.   The variable contains a good explanation of the
;; speed/accuracy trade-offs for each option.  Set it to what you'd
;; like, and call cc-lobotomy in your c-mode-hook.
;;
;; This will redefine certain cc-mode functions and affect all cc-mode
;; buffers globally.
;;
;; This file is completely unsupported!  I have no idea whether this
;; will work with such things as cc-mode-18.el.

(defvar cc-lobotomy-pith-list ()
  "*List of things to dumb-ify to speed up cc-mode.  Note that each
incurs a penalty in correct identification of certain code constructs.
Possible values to put on this list:

  'literal -- `c-in-literal' is lobotomized.  This will significantly
              speed up parsing over large lists of cpp macros, as seen
	      for instance in header files.  The penalty is that you
	      cannot put the `#' character as the first non-whitespace
	      character on a line inside other multi-line literals
	      (i.e. comments or strings)

  'class   -- `c-narrow-out-enclosing-class' and `c-search-uplist for
              classkey' are lobotomized.  This speeds up some
	      indenting inside and around class and struct
	      definitions.  The penalty is that elements inside of
	      classes and structs may not indent correctly.

  'lists   -- `c-inside-bracelist-p' is lobotomized.  This speeds up
              indenting inside and around brace lists (e.g. aggregate
	      initializers, enum lists, etc.).  The penalty is that
	      elements inside these lists may not indent correctly.")
