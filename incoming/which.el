;;; Commentary:

;; `which' is an interactive function which takes a program name (string)
;; as argument and searches all executables with this name in all paths of
;; the variable `exec-path'. Almost every Unix system (especially our
;; beloved GNU/Linux) has this command 'on board', some operating systems
;; don't have. On operating systems like Windows NT where there are
;; several meaningful extensions (e.g. "com", "exe") which can be a suffix
;; of an executable you can define a variable whose name is build from the
;; concatenation of "which-system-", the variable `system-type' and
;; "extensions". It is a list of extensions (strings) to append to the
;; program name given to the function `which'. If the environment variable
;; "PATHEXT" is available it is used instead!

;; `which-elisp' is an interactive function which takes a file name
;; (string) as argument and searches the files with this name and the
;; extension ".el" in all paths of the variable `load-path'.

;; If `which' or `which-elisp' are called interactively, they display the
;; found paths in the modeline. If called non-interactively, they return
;; the list of found paths.

;; The code does something usable, though not perfect.  Improvement
;; suggestions from Emacs experts are welcome.

;;; Installation:

;; e.g. in file .emacs: (require 'which)
;; Put a copy of which.el/.elc into some path of `load-path'. To show
;; `load-path': "C-h v" load-path RET

;;; ToDo:

;; - `file-name-handler-alist', some paths seem to be preceeded
;; - showing symbolic/hard links and doubles
;; - better documentation in header/code
;; - customizable which predicate to test file, e.g. `file-executable-p'
;;   or `file-exists-p' or user defined function
;; - From: Noah Friedman <friedman@splode.com>:
;;   http://www.splode.com/~friedman/software/emacs-lisp/, in particular,
;;   see fff.el and file-fns.el
;; - Better customization for extension variable
;; - `with-output-to-temp-buffer', (suggestion by ??)

;; Initial entry
;;

;; 02 Jul 2000 - v0.43:
;; - if called non-interactively, `which'/`which-elisp' don't display a
;;   string in the modeline, they just return the list of paths.
;; - if system-type is 'windows-nt or 'ms-dos, dos-w32 is `required' to be
;;   sure `path-separator' is defined on these systems.
;; - documentation update

;; 15 Jun 2000 - v0.42:
;; - changed email address to "christoph.conrad@gmx.de"

;; 15 Jun 2000 - v0.41:
;; - `which-result-separator' defaults to `path-separator'
;; - some `defcustom' keyword changes

;; 24 Dec 1999 - v0.4:
;; - copyright notice, minor change (no file COPYING)

;; 24 Dec 1999 - v0.3:
;; - `checkdoc'-ed, `lm-verify'-ed (lisp-mnt.el), `elint'-ed
;; - simple interface function `which-intern' for user defined functions
;;   with other searchpaths, predefined function `which-elisp' (David
;;   Biesack 13 Dec 1999)
;; - use PATHEXT under Windows NT if available (David Biesack 13 Dec 1999)
;; - do all assignments in let* (Jonas Steverud 11 Dec 1999)
;; - changed order of extensions for Windows NT when there is no
;;   PATHEXT-environment variable to the NT default value
;; - better documentation in header/code
;; - code reorganization
;; - Variable `which-separator' renamed to  `which-result-separator'
;; - Variable `which-<system-type>' renamed to
;;   `which-system-<system-type>-extensions'
;; - Fixed some bugs and typos.
;;
;; 11 Dec 1999 - v0.2:
;; - First public released version as package.
;;
;; 08 Dec 1999 - v0.1:
;; - First public released version, one function.
