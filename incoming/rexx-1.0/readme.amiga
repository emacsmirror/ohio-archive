	The Amigaport V1.26 of GNUEmacs has a annoying bug; it quotes
	all arguments to commands, therefore RX can't be called directly.

	A workaround is to specify rexx-command-name to "rxnq", which
	is a small (280 bytes!) command which strips the quotes and
	calls RX. To do this, place the following lines into the
	rxdb-mode-hook is the s:.emacs file.

		(setq rxdb-command-name "rxnq")

	And place rxnq in the loadpath.
