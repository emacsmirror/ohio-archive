EDE - Emacs Development Environment

Compiling instructions:

EDE depends on both EIEIO and SPEEDBAR while compiling.  As such, the
makefile included may not work if they are not in site-lisp, or other
system install area.

You can fetch the latest SPEEDBAR here (Version 0.8.1 or better):

http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/speedbar.shtml

You can fetch the latest EIEIO here (Version 0.11 or better):

http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/eieio.shtml

Once unpacked, you will need to tweek the Makefile to change the
LOADPATH variable to be correct for your situation.
