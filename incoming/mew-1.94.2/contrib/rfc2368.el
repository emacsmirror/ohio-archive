;;   -repeat after me: "the colon is not part of the header name..."
;;   -if w3 becomes part of emacs, then it may make sense to have this
;;    file depend on w3 -- the maintainer of w3 says merging w/ emacs
;;    is planned!
;;
;; historical note:
;;
;;   this is intended as a replacement for mailto.el
;;
;; acknowledgements:
;;
;;   the functions that deal w/ unhexifying in this file were basically
;; taken from w3 -- i hope to replace them w/ something else soon OR
;; perhaps if w3 becomes a part of emacs soon, use the functions from w3.

;;; History:
;;
;; 0.3:
;;
;;  added the constant rfc2368-version
;;  implemented first potential fix for a bug in rfc2368-mailto-regexp
;;  implemented first potential fix for a bug in rfc2368-parse-mailto
;;  (both bugs reported by Kenichi OKADA)
;;
;; 0.2:
;;
;;  started to use checkdoc
;;
;; 0.1:
;;
;;  initial implementation

;;; Code:
(defconst rfc2368-version "rfc2368.el 0.3")

;; only an approximation?
;; see rfc 1738
(defconst rfc2368-mailto-regexp
  "^\\(mailto:\\)\\([^?]+\\)*\\(\\?\\(.*\\)\\)*"
  "Regular expression to match and aid in parsing a mailto url.")

;; describes 'mailto:'
(defconst rfc2368-mailto-scheme-index 1

;; for dealing w/ unhexifying strings, my preferred approach is to use
;; a 'string-replace-match-using-function' which can perform a
;; string-replace-match and compute the replacement text based on a
;; passed function -- however, emacs doesn't seem to have such a
;; function yet :-(
