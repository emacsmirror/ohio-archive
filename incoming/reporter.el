;;; Commentary:

;; End User Interface
;; ==================
;; The variable `mail-user-agent' contains a symbol indicating which
;; Emacs mail package end users would like to use to compose outgoing
;; mail.  See that variable for details.

;; Mail Package Interface
;; ======================
;; Mail package authors can configure reporter to support their
;; package by calling the function `define-mail-user-agent' See that
;; function for details.

;; Lisp Package Authors
;; ====================
;; Reporter was written primarily for Emacs Lisp package authors so
;; that their users can easily report bugs.  When invoked,
;; reporter-submit-bug-report will set up an outgoing mail buffer with
;; the appropriate bug report address, including a lisp expression the
;; maintainer of the package can eval to completely reproduce the
;; environment in which the bug was observed (e.g. by using
;; eval-last-sexp).  This package proved especially useful during my
;; development of cc-mode, which is highly dependent on its
;; configuration variables.
;;
;; Do a "C-h f reporter-submit-bug-report" for more information.
;; Here's an example usage:
;;
;;(defconst mypkg-version "9.801")
;;(defconst mypkg-maintainer-address "mypkg-help@foo.com")
;;(defun mypkg-submit-bug-report ()
;;  "Submit via mail a bug report on mypkg"
;;  (interactive)
;;  (reporter-submit-bug-report
;;   mypkg-maintainer-address
;;   (concat "mypkg.el " mypkg-version)
;;   (list 'mypkg-variable-1
;;         'mypkg-variable-2
;;         ;; ...
;;         'mypkg-variable-last)))

;; Mailing List
;; ============
;; I've set up a Majordomo mailing list to report bugs or suggest
;; enhancements, etc.  This list's intended audience is elisp package
;; authors who are using reporter and want to stay current with
;; releases. Here are the relevant addresses:
;;
;; Administrivia: reporter-request@python.org
;; Submissions:   reporter@python.org

;; Packages that currently use reporter are: cc-mode, supercite, elp,
;; tcl, ediff, crypt++ (crypt), dired-x, rmailgen, mode-line, vm,
;; mh-e, edebug, archie, viper, w3-mode, framepop, hl319, hilit19,
;; pgp, eos, hm--html, efs.

Various Emacs Lisp packages (e.g. reporter) require you to compose an

for Emacs, you can indicate your preference by setting this variable.

Valid values currently are:

    'vm-user-agent       -- use Kyle Jones' VM package

string.

Default behavior is to not prompt (i.e. nil). If you want reporter to
prompt, you should `let' bind this variable before calling
`reporter-submit-bug-report'.  Note that this variable is not
buffer-local so you should never just `setq' it.")

When non-nil, this must be a list of variable symbols.  When a
variable containing a list value is formatted in the bug report mail

number of lines.  If the variable's symbol appears in this list, its
value is printed in a more verbose style, specifically, one elemental
sexp per line.

The property names are equivalent to the formal argument described
below (but in lower case).  Additional properties can be placed on the
symbol.

COMPOSEFUNC is program callable function that composes an outgoing
mail message buffer.  This function should set up the basics of the
buffer without requiring user interaction.  It should populate the
standard mail headers, leaving the `to:' and `subject:' headers blank.

SENDFUNC is the command a user would type to send the message.

Optional ABORTFUNC is the command a user would type to abort the
message.  For mail packages that don't have a separate abort function,
this can be `kill-buffer' (the equivalent of omitting this argument).

Optional HOOKVAR is a hook variable that gets run before the message
is actually sent.  Reporter will install `reporter-bug-hook' onto this
hook so that empty bug reports can be suppressed by raising an error.
If not supplied, `mail-send-hook' will be used."
