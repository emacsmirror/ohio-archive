;;; Commentary:

;; This code somewhat automates complaints about unsolicited commercial e-mail
;; (uce). Essentially, it prepares a message based on some standard text and
;; (parts of) the offending mail, and addresses it to a number of mailboxes.
;; All you have to do is check the message (especially the list of recipients)
;; for sanity, and send it.

;; gnus-junk is intended for Gnus and Message (which is included in the Gnus
;; distribution). But you guessed this from the name, didn't you, you
;; clever-dick? In fact, the dependencies are not dramatic, and
;; conversion/generalization to other Emacs-based MUAs is possible. But who
;; would want to read mail by other means than with Gnus? And, no, I won't
;; write a version for Pine. Feel free to do it yourself!

;; The main function is gnus-junk-complain, which does all the things
;; described above. It is intended to be bound to a key in gnus-summary-map.

;; A few ideas were taken from Stanislav Shalunov's `uce.el'.


;; Compatibility:

;; This version of gnus-junk should work with Gnus 5.3 and above. These Gnusii
;; in turn need Emacs 19.32 (and better), or XEmacs 19.14 (and better) to
;; work. The newest version of Gnus is availiable from
;; <http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/gnus.tar.gz>.

;; gnus-junk supports Customization, if you have a recent version of `custom'.
;; A sufficient version comes with Gnus 5.4 and above (or Red Gnus >=0.36). So
;; you can upgrade by getting the newest Gnus (see above) or fetching custom
;; separately from <http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/>. Or get Emacs
;; 19.35 (not availiable at time of writing), XEmacs 20.2, or XEmacs 19.15.


;; Installation:

;; Get it! The newest version of gnus-junk is availiable at the above URL.

;; Put gnus-junk somewhere into your loadpath (for example into the directory
;; where Gnus resides).

;; Insert the following into your .emacs or .gnus file:

;; (autoload 'gnus-junk-complain "gnus-junk" "(not loaded yet)" t)
;; (add-hook 'gnus-sum-load-hook (lambda nil
;;				(define-key gnus-summary-mode-map [(?$)]
;;				  'gnus-junk-complain)))


;; Future Plans:

;; Select from a couple of complaint-texts. For example, the legal text cited
;; below applies only to US-spammers. What are the criterias?

;; Additionally, MMF/pyramid scams by US-citizens should probably be cc'ed to
;; the IRS and/or FBI. Again: How do you recognize US-addresses?

;; Should we read more headers?

;; Be more intelligent about `Received:'

;; Use `whois' or `traceroute' if possible, to gain more information. For
;; example one could find if the ISP is in the USA, which would help with the
;; above issues.

;; If tm is availiable, generate MIME-messages.

;; Incooperate other types of complaints or automatic replys: EMP, ECP,
;; perhaps even vacation-like features. This would necessiate a change of
;; name.


;; Final words:

;; If you have any comments or bug-reports, just send them to the
;; address mentioned above.

This is a list of lists, the car of each being one of: `from', `sender',
`reply-to', `received', or `message-id'. The cdr lists the recipients on the

replaced by the whole address, when processing `from' or `sender'.

During address collection, each of the relevant headers is processed. If
a list with an appropriate carr is found, a hostname is extracted from the
header and used in conjunction with the list's cdr to construct the complete
recipient-addresses. This is done by appending `@' and the hostname to each
recipient. If the recipient is not a string, but rather the symbol `t', the
complete mail-address from the header is taken instead. Using this with
`received' or `message-id' (which contain no mail-address) yields undefined
