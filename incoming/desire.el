  "Arrange loading and configuration of a desired emacs PACKAGE.
PACKAGE is a symbol representing the name of a package.  The aim is to
set up some autoloads and other initial configuration, and possibly
organise for more configuration files to be dynamically loaded when
the package itself is finally loaded.  The optional argument FNAME is
a string containing the name of the file that, when loaded, will
trigger dynamic loading of extra configuration files.  If FNAME is
omitted then the string corresponding to PACKAGE is used instead.

Each directory in `desire-load-path' is searched in order to see if
configuration data for PACKAGE exists.  The configuration data takes
one of 2 forms:

1. A file named PACKAGE followed by the value of the variable
   `desire-extension'.  If such a file exists, then that file is taken
   to be the sole configuration file for the package.  This file is
   loaded immediately.  The file might contain autoloads or might load
   the package itself.

2. A directory named PACKAGE.  If the directory contains a file
   corresponding to `desire-loaddefs' then that file is loaded
   immediately.  Other files in the directory are processed using the
   function `desire-process-directory' after the package is actually
   loaded. 

Note that a single file, as described in (1), takes precedence over a
directory, as described in (2).  For a directory, if the package has
already been loaded then the configuration data *is* loaded but the
package is *not*.  This depends on the `eval-after-load' function
behaving similarly.

If a package is successfully configured then it is `desired' and,
therefore, marked as `desirable'.  Desirability can be checked using
the function `desiredp'.  If PACKAGE has been previously `desired'
then nothing happens and nil is returned."
