<h1><small>TRAMP</small> User Manual</h1>

<p><small>TRAMP</small> stands for `Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple
Protocol'.  This package provides remote file editing, similar to
<cite>ange-ftp</cite> and <cite>EFS</cite>.

<p>The difference is that ange-ftp uses FTP to transfer files between the
local and the remote host, whereas <small>TRAMP</small> uses a combination of
<code>rsh</code> and <code>rcp</code> or other work-alike programs, such as
<code>ssh</code>/<code>scp</code>.

<p>This is version $Revision: 1.30 $ of the <small>TRAMP</small> manual, last updated on
Wednesday, 7 June, 2000.

<p>You can find the latest version of this document on the web at
&lt;<code>http://ls6-www.informatik.uni-dortmund.de/~grossjoh/emacs/tramp.html</code>&gt;.

<h1>An overview of <small>TRAMP</small></h1>

<p>After the installation of <small>TRAMP</small> into your Emacs, you will be able to
access files on remote machines as though they were local. Access to the
remote file system for editing files, version control, and
<code>dired</code> are transparently enabled.

<p>Your access to the remote machine can be with the <code>rsh</code>,
<code>rlogin</code>, <code>telnet</code> programs or with any similar
connection method. This connection must pass ASCII successfully to be
usable but need not be 8-bit clean.

<p>The package provides support for <code>ssh</code> connections out of the
box, one of the more common uses of the package. This allows relatively
secure access to machines, especially if <code>ftp</code> access is
disabled.

<p>The majority of activity carried out by <small>TRAMP</small> requires only that the
remote login is possible and is carried out at the terminal. In order to
access remote files <small>TRAMP</small> needs to transfer their content to the local
machine temporarily.

<p><small>TRAMP</small> can transfer files between the machines in a variety of ways. The
details are easy to select, depending on your needs and the machines in
question.

<p>The fastest transfer methods rely on a remote file transfer package such
as <code>rcp</code>, <code>scp</code> or <code>rsync</code>. The use of these
methods is only possible if the file copy command does not ask for a
password for the remote machine.

<p>If the remote copy methods are not suitable for you, <small>TRAMP</small> also
supports the use of encoded transfers directly through the shell. This
requires that the <code>mimencode</code> or <code>uuencode</code> tools are
available on the remote machine.

<p>Within these limitations, <small>TRAMP</small> is quite powerful. It is worth noting
that, as of the time of writing, it is far from a polished end-user
product. For a while yet you should expect to run into rough edges and
problems with the code now and then.

<p>It is finished enough that the developers use it for day to day work but
the installation and setup can be a little difficult to master, as can
the terminology.

<p><small>TRAMP</small> is still under active development and any problems you encounter,
trivial or major, should be reported to the <small>TRAMP</small> developers. 
See <a href="#Bug%20Reports">Bug Reports</a>.

<h4>Behind the scenes</h4>

<p>This section tries to explain what goes on behind the scenes when you
access a remote file through <small>TRAMP</small>.

<p>Suppose you type <kbd>C-x C-f</kbd> and enter part of an <small>TRAMP</small> file name,
then hit <kbd>&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd> for completion.  Suppose further that this is
the first time that <small>TRAMP</small> is invoked for the host in question.  Here's
what happens:

<ul>
<li><small>TRAMP</small> discovers that it needs a connection to the host. So it invokes
<code>telnet HOST</code> or <code>rsh HOST -l USER</code> or a similar tool to
connect to the remote host. Communication with this process happens
through an Emacs buffer, that is, the output from the remote end goes
into a buffer.

<li>The remote host may prompt for a login name (for <code>telnet</code>).  The
login name is given in the file name, so <small>TRAMP</small> sends the login name and
a newline.

<li>The remote host may prompt for a password or pass phrase (for
<code>rsh</code> or for <code>telnet</code> after sending the login name). 
<small>TRAMP</small> displays the prompt in the minibuffer, asking you for the
password or pass phrase.

<p>You enter the password or pass phrase.  <small>TRAMP</small> sends it to the remote
host, followed by a newline.

</p><li><small>TRAMP</small> now waits for the shell prompt or for a message that the login
failed.

<p>If <small>TRAMP</small> sees neither of them after a certain period of time (a minute,
say), then it issues an error message saying that it couldn't find the
remote shell prompt and shows you what the remote host has sent.

<p>If <small>TRAMP</small> sees a `login failed' message, it tells you so, aborts the
login attempt and allows you to try again.

</p><li>Suppose that the login was successful and <small>TRAMP</small> sees the shell prompt
from the remote host.  Now <small>TRAMP</small> invokes <code>/bin/sh</code> because
Bourne shells and C shells have different command
syntaxes.<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<p>After the Bourne shell has come up, <small>TRAMP</small> sends a few commands to
ensure a good working environment.  It turns off echoing, it sets the
shell prompt, and a few other things.

</p><li>Now the remote shell is up and it good working order.  Remember, what
was supposed to happen is that <small>TRAMP</small> tries to find out what files exist
on the remote host so that it can do filename completion.

<p>So, <small>TRAMP</small> basically issues <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> commands and
also sometimes <code>echo</code> with globbing.  Another command that is
often used is <code>test</code> to find out whether a file is writable or a
directory or the like.  The output of each command is parsed for the
necessary operation.

</p><li>Suppose you are finished with filename completion, have entered <kbd>C-x
C-f</kbd>, a full file name and hit <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.  Now comes the time to
transfer the file contents from the remote host to the local host so
that you can edit them.

<p>See above for an explanation of how <small>TRAMP</small> transfers the file contents.

<p>For inline transfers, <small>TRAMP</small> issues a command like <code>mimencode -b
/path/to/remote/file</code>, waits until the output has accumulated in the
buffer that's used for communication, then decodes that output to
produce the file contents.

<p>For out-of-band transfers, <small>TRAMP</small> issues a command like <code>rcp
user@host:/path/to/remote/file /tmp/tramp.4711</code> and then reads the local
temporary file <code>/tmp/tramp.4711</code> into a buffer and deletes the
temporary file.

</p><li>You now edit the buffer contents, blithely unaware of what has happened
behind the scenes.  (Unless you have read this section, that is.)  When
you are finished, you type <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd> to save the buffer.

<li>Again, <small>TRAMP</small> transfers the file contents to the remote host either
inline or out-of-band.  This is the reverse of what happens when reading
the file.

</ul>

<p>I hope this has provided you with a basic overview of what happens
behind the scenes when you open a file with <small>TRAMP</small>.

<h1>History of <small>TRAMP</small></h1>

<p>Development was started end of November 1998.  The package was called
`rssh.el', back then.  It only provided one method to access a file,
using <code>ssh</code> to log in to a remote host and using <code>scp</code>
to transfer the file contents.  After a while, the name was changed to
`rcp.el', and now it's <small>TRAMP</small>.  Along the way, many more methods for
getting a remote shell and for transferring the file contents were
added.  Support for VC was added.

<p>The most recent addition of a major feature was the multi-hop methods
added in April 2000.

<h1>Installing <small>TRAMP</small> into Emacs or XEmacs</h1>

<p>Installing <small>TRAMP</small> into your Emacs or XEmacs is a relatively easy
process, at least compared to rebuilding your machine from scratch. ;)

<p>Seriously though, the installation should be a fairly simple matter.

<p>The easiest way to proceed is as follows:

<ul>
<li>Choose a directory, say <code>~/emacs/</code>.  Change into that directory and
unpack the tarball.  This will give you a directory
<code>~/emacs/tramp/</code> which contains subdirectories <code>lisp</code> for the
Lisp code and <code>texi</code> for the documentation.

<li>Optionally byte-compile all files in the Lisp directory,
<code>~/emacs/tramp/lisp/</code>, by issuing a command like the following from
that directory:
<pre>make EMACS=emacs all            # for Emacs users
make EMACS=xemacs all           # for XEmacs users
</pre>

<li>Tell Emacs about the new Lisp directory and the <small>TRAMP</small> package, with
the following lines in <code>~/.emacs</code>:
<pre>(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs/tramp/lisp/")
(require 'tramp)
</pre>

<li>To be able to read the Info documentation, create a file
<code>~/emacs/tramp/texi/dir</code> using for example the
<code>install-info</code> command, and add the directory to the search path
for Info.

<p>If the environment variable <code>$INFOPATH</code> is set, add the directory
<code>~/emacs/tramp/texi/</code> to it.  Else, add the directory to
<var>Info-default-directory-list</var>, as follows:
<pre>(add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "~/emacs/tramp/texi/")
</pre>
XEmacs 21 users should use <var>Info-directory-list</var> rather than
<var>Info-default-directory-list</var>.

</ul>

<p>After placing the <code>tramp.el</code> file in a directory in your Emacs
<var>load-path</var>, you need to load the <small>TRAMP</small> library.

<p>Because of interactions between <small>TRAMP</small> and the <code>efs</code> and
<code>ange-ftp</code> packages, these packages <em>must</em> be loaded into
Emacs <em>before</em> the <small>TRAMP</small> package is loaded.

<p>If you do not load these packages then <small>TRAMP</small> will fail in nasty and
irritating ways. This is not a good thing.

<p>So, under GNU Emacs you should add the following commands to your
<code>.emacs</code> file:

<pre>(require 'ange-ftp)     <i>; GNU Emacs ships with this</i>
(require 'tramp)
</pre>

<p>Under XEmacs this should be:

<pre>(require 'efs)          <i>; XEmacs uses EFS rather than ange-ftp</i>
(require 'tramp)
</pre>

<p>For XEmacs users, the package <code>fsf-compat</code> must be installed. 
For details on package installation, see <a href="xemacs.html#Packages">Packages</a>.

<h1>Configuring <small>TRAMP</small> for use</h1>

<p><small>TRAMP</small> is fully functional when it is initially installed. It is
initially configured to use the <code>rsh</code> and <code>rcp</code> programs
to connect to the remote host.

<p>If you do not wish to use these commands to connect to the remote host,
you should change the default connection and transfer method that <small>TRAMP</small>
uses. There are several different methods that <small>TRAMP</small> can use to
connect to remote machines and transfer files (see <a href="#Connection%20types">Connection types</a>).

<br>

<h2>Types of connections made to remote machines.</h2>

<p>There are two basic types of transfer methods, each with it's own
advantages and limitations. Both types of connection make use of a
remote shell access program such as <code>rsh</code>, <code>ssh</code> or
<code>telnet</code> to connect to the remote machine.

<p>This connection is used to perform many of the operations that <small>TRAMP</small>
requires to make the remote file system transparently accessible from
the local machine. It is only when visiting files that the methods
differ.

<p>Loading or saving a remote file requires that the content of the file be
transfered between the two machines. The content of the file can be
transfered over the same connection used to log in to the remote machine
or the file can be transfered through another connection using a remote
copy program such as <code>rcp</code>, <code>scp</code> or <code>rsync</code>. 
The former are called <dfn>inline methods</dfn>, the latter are called
<dfn>external transfer methods</dfn>.

<p>The performance of the external transfer methods is generally better
than that of the inline methods. This is caused by the need to encode
and decode the data when transferring inline.

<p>The one exception to this rule are the <code>scp</code> based transfer
methods. While these methods do see better performance when actually
transferring files, the overhead of the cryptographic negotiation at
startup may drown out the improvement in file transfer times.

<p>External transfer methods do require that the remote copy command is not
interactive -- that is, the command does not prompt you for a password. 
If you cannot perform remote copies without a password, you will need to
use an inline transfer method to work with <small>TRAMP</small>.

<p>A variant of the inline methods are the <dfn>multi-hop methods</dfn>. 
These methods allow you to connect a remote host using a number `hops',
each of which connects to a different host.  This is useful if you are
in a secured network where you need to go through a bastion host to
connect to the outside world.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Configuration">Configuration</a>
<br>

<h2>Inline methods</h2>

<p>The inline methods in <small>TRAMP</small> are quite powerful and can work in
situations where you cannot use an external transfer program to connect. 
Inline methods are the only methods that work when connecting to the
remote machine via telnet.  (There are also strange inline methods which
allow you to transfer files between <em>user identities</em> rather than
hosts, see below.)

<p>These methods depend on the existence of a suitable encoding and
decoding command on remote machine. Locally, <small>TRAMP</small> may be able to use
features of Emacs to decode and encode the files or it may require
access to external commands to perform that task.

<p><small>TRAMP</small> supports the use of <code>uuencode</code> to transfer files. This is
<em>not</em> recommended. The <code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code>
commands are not well standardized and may not function correctly or at
all on some machines, notably AIX and IRIX. These systems do not work
with <code>uuencode</code> at all.  (But do see the note about AIX in the
documentation for <var>tramp-methods</var>.)

<p>In summary, if possible use the <code>mimencode</code> methods to transfer
the data base64 encoded. This has the advantage of using a built-in
command in every modern Emacs, improving performance.

<ul>
<li><code>rm</code>  --  <code>rsh</code> with <code>mimencode</code>

<p>Connect to the remote host with <code>rsh</code> and use base64 encoding to
transfer files between the machines.

<p>This requires the <code>mimencode</code> command that is part of the
<code>metamail</code> packages. This may not be installed on all remote
machines.

</p><li><code>sm</code>  --  <code>ssh</code> with <code>mimencode</code>

<p>Connect to the remote host with <code>ssh</code> and use base64 encoding to
transfer files between the machines.

<p>This is identical to the previous option except that the <code>ssh</code>
package is used, making the connection more secure.

<p>There are also two variants, <code>sm1</code> and <code>sm2</code> that use the
<code>ssh1</code> and <code>ssh2</code> commands explicitly. If you don't know
what these are, you do not need these options.

</p><li><code>tm</code>  --  <code>telnet</code> with <code>mimencode</code>

<p>Connect to the remote host with <code>telnet</code> and use base64 encoding
to transfer files between the machines.

<p>This requires the <code>mimencode</code> command that is part of the
<code>metamail</code> packages.

</p><li><code>ru</code>  --  <code>rsh</code> with <code>uuencode</code>

<p>Connect to the remote host with <code>rsh</code> and use the
<code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code> commands to transfer files
between the machines.

</p><li><code>su</code>  --  <code>ssh</code> with <code>uuencode</code>

<p>Connect to the remote host with <code>ssh</code> and use the
<code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code> commands to transfer files
between the machines.

<p>As with the <code>ssh</code> and base64 option above, this provides the
<code>su1</code> and <code>su2</code> methods to explicitly select an ssh
version.

<p>Note that this method does not invoke the <code>su</code> program, see
below for methods which use that.

</p><li><code>tu</code>  --  <code>telnet</code> with <code>uuencode</code>

<p>Connect to the remote host with <code>telnet</code> and use the
<code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code> commands to transfer files
between the machines.

</p><li><code>sum</code> -- <code>su</code> with <code>mimencode</code>

<p>This method does not connect to a remote host at all, rather it uses the
<code>su</code> program to allow you to edit files as another user.  Uses
base64 encoding to transfer the file contents.

</p><li><code>suu</code> -- <code>su</code> with <code>uuencode</code>

<p>Like <code>sum</code>, this uses the <code>su</code> program to allow you to
edit files on the local host as another user.  Uses <code>uuencode</code>
and <code>uudecode</code> to transfer the file contents.

</p><li><code>sudm</code> -- <code>sudo</code> with <code>mimencode</code>

<p>This is similar to the <code>sum</code> method, but it uses <code>sudo</code>
rather than <code>su</code> to become a different user.

<p>Note that <code>sudo</code> must be configured to allow you to start a
shell as the user.  It would be nice if it was sufficient if
<code>ls</code> and <code>mimencode</code> were allowed, but that is not easy
to implement, so I haven't got around to it, yet.

</p><li><code>sudu</code> -- <code>sudo</code> with <code>uuencode</code>

<p>This is similar to the <code>suu</code> method, but it uses <code>sudo</code>
rather than <code>su</code> to become a different user.

</ul>

<h2>External transfer methods</h2>

<p>The external transfer methods operate through multiple channels, using
the remote shell connection for many actions while delegating file
transfers to an external transfer utility.

<p>This saves the overhead of encoding and decoding that multiplexing the
transfer through the one connection has with the inline methods.

<p>If you want to use an external transfer method you <em>must</em> be able
to execute the transfer utility to copy files to and from the remote
machine without any interaction.

<p>This means that you will need to use <code>ssh-agent</code> if you use the
<code>scp</code> program for transfers. If you use <code>rsync</code> via
<code>ssh</code> then the same rule must apply to that connection.

<p>If you cannot get <code>scp</code> to run without asking for a password but
would still like to use <code>ssh</code> to secure your connection, have a
look at the <code>ssh</code> based inline methods.

<ul>
<li><code>rcp</code>  --  <code>rsh</code> and <code>rcp</code>

<p>This method uses the <code>rsh</code> and <code>rcp</code> commands to connect
to the remote machine and transfer files. This is probably the fastest
connection method available.

</p><li><code>scp</code>  --  <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code>

<p>Using <code>ssh</code> to connect to the remote host and <code>scp</code> to
transfer files between the machines is the best method for securely
connecting to a remote machine and accessing files.

<p>The performance of this option is also quite good. It may be slower than
the inline methods when you often open and close small files however. 
The cost of the cryptographic handshake at the start of an <code>scp</code>
session can begin to absorb the advantage that the lack of encoding and
decoding presents.

</p><li><code>rsync</code>  --  <code>ssh</code> and <code>rsync</code>

<p>Using the <code>ssh</code> command to connect securely to the remote
machine and the <code>rsync</code> command to transfer files is almost
identical to the <code>scp</code> method.

<p>While <code>rsync</code> performs much better than <code>scp</code> when
transferring files that exist on both hosts, this advantage is lost if
the file exists only on one side of the connection.

<p>The <code>rsync</code> based method may be considerably faster than the
<code>rcp</code> based methods when writing to the remote system. Reading
files to the local machine is no faster than with a direct copy.

</p><li><code>scpx</code> -- <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code>

<p>As you expect, this is similar to <code>scp</code>, only a little
different.  Whereas <code>scp</code> opens a normal interactive shell on the
remote host, this option uses <code>ssh -t HOST -l user /bin/sh</code> to
open a connection.  This is useful for users where the normal login
shell is set up to ask them a number of question when logging in.  This
procedure avoids these questions, and just gives <small>TRAMP</small> a more-or-less
`standard' login shell to work with.

<h2>Connecting to a remote host using multiple hops</h2>

<p>Sometimes, the methods described before are not sufficient.  Sometimes,
it is not possible to connect to a remote host using a simple command. 
For example, if you are in a secured network, you might have to log in
to a `bastion host' first before you can connect to the outside world. 
Of course, the target host may also require a bastion host.  The format
of multi-hop filenames is slightly different than the format of normal
<small>TRAMP</small> methods.

<p>A multi-hop file name specifies a method, a number of hops, and a path
name on the remote system.  The method specifies how the file is
transferred through the inline connection.  The following two multi-hop
methods are available:

<ul>
<li><code>multi</code> -- base64 encoding with <code>mimencode</code>

<p>The file is transferred through the connection in base64 encoding.  Uses
the <code>mimencode</code> program for doing encoding and decoding, but
uses an Emacs internal implementation on the local host if available.

</p><li><code>multiu</code> -- use commands <code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code>

<p>The file is transferred through the connection in `uu' encoding.  Uses
the <code>uuencode</code> and <code>uudecode</code> programs for encoding and
decoding, but uses a Lisp implementation for decoding on the local host
if available.

</ul>

<p>Each hop consists of a <dfn>hop method</dfn> specification, a user name and a
host name.  The following hop methods are (currently) available:

<ul>
<li><code>telnet</code>

<p>Uses the well-known <code>telnet</code> program to connect to the host. 
Whereas user name and host name are supplied in the file name, the
user is queried for the password.

</p><li><code>rsh</code>

<p>This uses <code>rsh</code> to connect to the host.  You do not need to
enter a password unless <code>rsh</code> explicitly asks for it.

</p><li><code>ssh</code>

<p>This uses <code>ssh</code> to connect to the host.  You might have to enter
a password or a pass phrase.

</p><li><code>su</code>

<p>This method does not actually contact a different host, but it allows
you to become a different user on the host you're currently on.  This
might be useful if you want to edit files as root, but the remote host
does not allow remote root logins.  In this case you can use
<code>telnet</code>, <code>rsh</code> or <code>ssh</code> to connect to the
remote host as a non-root user, then use an <code>su</code> hop to become
root.  But <code>su</code> need not be the last hop in a sequence, you could
also use it somewhere in the middle, if the need arises.

<p>Even though you <em>must</em> specify both user and host with a
<code>su</code> hop, the host name is ignored and only the user name is
used.

</p><li><code>sudo</code>

<p>This is similar to the <code>su</code> hop, except that it uses
<code>sudo</code> rather than <code>su</code> to become a different user.

</ul>

<h2>Selecting a default method</h2>

<p>When you select an appropriate transfer method for your typical usage
you should set the variable <var>tramp-default-method</var> to reflect that
choice. This variable controls which method will be used when a method
is not specified in the <small>TRAMP</small> file path.

<p>External transfer methods are normally preferable to inline transfer
methods, giving better performance. They may not be useful if you use
many remote machines where you cannot log in without a password.

<p>See <a href="#Inline%20methods">Inline methods</a>. 
See <a href="#External%20transfer%20methods">External transfer methods</a>. 
See <a href="#Multi-hop%20Methods">Multi-hop Methods</a>.

<p>Another consideration with the selection of transfer methods is the
environment you will use them in and, especially when used over the
Internet, the security implications of your preferred method.

<p>The <code>rsh</code> and <code>telnet</code> methods send your password as
plain text as you log in to the remote machine, as well as transferring
the files in such a way that the content can easily be read from other
machines.

<p>If you need to connect to remote systems that are accessible from the
Internet, you should give serious thought to using <code>ssh</code> based
methods to connect. These provide a much higher level of security,
making it a non-trivial exercise for someone to obtain your password or
read the content of the files you are editing.

<h2>Using Non-Standard Methods</h2>

<p>There is a variable <code>tramp-methods</code> which you can change if the
predefined methods don't seem right.

<p>For the time being, I'll refer you to the Lisp documentation of that
variable, accessible with <kbd>C-h v tramp-methods &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

<h2>How <small>TRAMP</small> finds and uses programs on the remote machine.</h2>

<p><small>TRAMP</small> depends on a number of programs on the remote host in order to
function, including <code>ls</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>find</code> and
<code>cat</code>.

<p>In addition to these required tools, there are various tools that may be
required based on the connection method. See <a href="#Inline%20methods">Inline methods</a> and
<a href="#External%20transfer%20methods">External transfer methods</a> for details on these.

<p>Certain other tools, such as <code>perl</code> (or <code>perl5</code>) and
<code>grep</code> will be used if they can be found. When they are
available, they are used to improve the performance and accuracy of
remote file access.

<p>When <small>TRAMP</small> connects to the remote machine, it searches for the
programs that it can use. The variable <var>tramp-remote-path</var> controls
the directories searched on the remote machine.

<p>By default, this is set to a reasonable set of defaults for most
machines. It is possible, however, that your local (or remote ;) system
administrator has put the tools you want in some obscure local
directory.

<p>In this case, you can still use them with <small>TRAMP</small>. You simply need to
add code to your <code>.emacs</code> to add the directory to the remote path. 
This will then be searched by <small>TRAMP</small> when you connect and the software
found.

<p>To add a directory to the remote search path, you could use code such
as:

<pre>(require 'tramp)                <i>; <small>TRAMP</small> must be loaded before this</i>
                                <i>; happens.</i>

<i>; We have <code>perl</code> in "/usr/local/perl"</i>
(add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path "/usr/local/perl")
</pre>

<h1>Using <small>TRAMP</small></h1>

<p>Once you have installed <small>TRAMP</small> it will operate fairly transparently. You
will be able to access files on any remote machine that you can log in
to as though they were local.

<p>Files are specified to <small>TRAMP</small> using a formalized syntax specifying the
details of the system to connect to. This is similar to the syntax used
by the <code>EFS</code> and <code>ange-ftp</code> packages.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Usage">Usage</a>
<br>

<h2><small>TRAMP</small> filename conventions</h2>

<p>To access the file &lt;path&gt; on the remote machine &lt;machine&gt; you would
specify the filename <code>/r:&lt;machine&gt;:&lt;path&gt;</code>. This will connect to
&lt;machine&gt; and transfer the file using the default method. 
See <a href="#Default%20Method">Default Method</a>.

<p>Some examples of <small>TRAMP</small> filenames are:

<dl>
<dt><code>/r:melancholia:.emacs</code>
<dd>Edit the file <code>.emacs</code> in your home directory on the machine
<code>melancholia</code>.

<br><dt><code>/r:melancholia.danann.net:.emacs</code>
<dd>This edits the same file, using the fully qualified domain name of
the machine.

<br><dt><code>/r:melancholia:~/.emacs</code>
<dd>This also edits the same file -- the <code>~</code> is expanded to your
home directory on the remote machine, just like it is locally.

<br><dt><code>/r:melancholia:~daniel/.emacs</code>
<dd>This edits the file <code>.emacs</code> in the home directory of the user
<code>daniel</code> on the machine <code>melancholia</code>. The <code>~&lt;user&gt;</code>
construct is expanded to the home directory of that user on the remote
machine.

<br><dt><code>/r:melancholia:/etc/squid.conf</code>
<dd>This edits the file <code>/etc/squid.conf</code> on the machine
<code>melancholia</code>.

</dl>

<p>Unless you specify a different name to use, <small>TRAMP</small> will use the current
local user name as the remote user name to log in with. If you need to
log in as a different user, you can specify the user name as part of the
filename.

<p>To log in to the remote machine as a specific user, you use the syntax
<code>/r:&lt;user&gt;@&lt;machine&gt;:/path/to.file</code>. That means that connecting to
<code>melancholia</code> as <code>daniel</code> and editing <code>.emacs</code> in your
home directory you would specify <code>/r:daniel@melancholia:.emacs</code>.

<p>It is also possible to specify other file transfer methods
(see <a href="#Default%20Method">Default Method</a>) as part of the filename. This is done by
replacing the initial <code>/r:</code> with <code>/r@&lt;method&gt;:</code>. The user,
machine and file specification remain the same.

<p>So, to connect to the machine <code>melancholia</code> as <code>daniel</code>, using
the <code>su</code> method to transfer files, and edit <code>.emacs</code> in my
home directory I would specify the filename
<code>/r@su:daniel@melancholia:.emacs</code>.

<h2>Multi-hop filename conventions</h2>

<p>The syntax of multi-hop file names is necessarily slightly different
than the syntax of other <small>TRAMP</small> file names.  Here's an example multi-hop
file name:

<p><code>/r@multi:rsh#out@gate:telnet#kai@real.host:/path/to.file</code>

<p>This is quite a mouthful.  So let's go through it step by step.  The
file name consists of three parts, separated by colons.  The first part
is <code>/r@multi</code>, the method specification.  The second part is
<code>rsh#out@gate:telnet#kai@real.host</code> and specifies the hops. 
(Yes, the second part may contain even more colons, so that's why this
file name has more than two colons in it.)  The final part is
<code>/path/to.file</code> and specifies the file name on the remote host.

<p>The first part and the final part should be clear.  <a href="#Multi-hop%20Methods">Multi-hop Methods</a>, for a list of alternatives for the method specification.

<p>The second part can be subdivided again into components, so-called hops. 
In the above file name, there are two hops, <code>rsh#out@gate</code> and
<code>telnet#kai@real.host</code>.

<p>Each hop can <em>again</em> be subdivided into (three) components, the
<dfn>hop method</dfn>, the <dfn>user name</dfn> and the <dfn>host name</dfn>.  The
meaning of the second and third component should be clear, and the hop
method says what program to use to perform that hop.

<p>The first hop, <code>rsh#out@gate</code>, says to use <code>rsh</code> to log in
as user <code>out</code> to the host <code>gate</code>.  Starting at that host, the
second hop, <code>telnet#kai@real.host</code>, says to use <code>telnet</code>
to log in as user <code>kai</code> to host <code>real.host</code>.

<p>See <a href="#Multi-hop%20Methods">Multi-hop Methods</a>, for a list of possible hop method values.  The
variable <var>tramp-multi-connection-function-alist</var> contains the list of
possible hop methods and information on how to execute them, should you
want to add your own.

<h2>Dired and filename completion</h2>

<p><small>TRAMP</small> works transparently with dired, enabling you to use this powerful
file management tool to manage files on any machine you have access to
over the Internet.

<p>Filename completion also works with <small>TRAMP</small> for files on remote machines
although there is no completion for user names or machine names at this
stage.

<p>As filename completion needs to fetch the listing of files from the
remote machine, this feature is sometimes fairly slow. As <small>TRAMP</small> does not
yet cache the results of directory listing, there is no gain in
performance the second time you complete filenames.

<p>If you need to browse a directory tree, Dired is a better choice, at
present, than filename completion. Dired has it's own cache mechanism
and will only fetch the directory listing once.

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li>Where can I get the latest <small>TRAMP</small>?

<p><small>TRAMP</small> is available at
&lt;<code>ftp://ls6-ftp.cs.uni-dortmund.de/pub/src/emacs/tramp.tar.gz</code>&gt;.

<li>Which systems does it work on?

<p>The package has been used successfully on Emacs 20 and Emacs 21, as well
as XEmacs 21.  XEmacs 20 is more problematic, see the notes in
<code>tramp.el</code>.  I don't think anybody has really tried it on Emacs 19.

<p>The package was intended to work on Unix, and it really expects a
Unix-like system on the remote end, but some people seemed to have some
success getting it to work on NT Emacs.

<p>??? Is the XEmacs info correct?

<p>??? Can somebody provide some information for getting it to work on NT
Emacs?  I think there was some issue with <code>ssh</code>?

</p><li>I can't stop EFS starting with XEmacs

<p>Not all the older versions of <small>TRAMP</small> supported XEmacs correctly. The
first thing to do is to make sure that you have the latest version of
<small>TRAMP</small> installed.

<p>If you do, please try and find out exactly the conditions required for
the <code>EFS</code> handlers to fire. If you can, putting a breakpoint on
<code>efs-ftp-path</code> and sending in the stack trace along with your bug
report would make it easier for the developers to work out what is going
wrong.

</p><li>File name completion does not work with <small>TRAMP</small>

<p>When you log in to the remote machine, do you see the output of
<code>ls</code> in color? If so, this may be the cause of your problems.

<p><code>ls</code> outputs <small>ANSI</small> escape sequences that your terminal
emulator interprets to set the colors. These escape sequences will
confuse <small>TRAMP</small> however.

<p>In your <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.profile</code> or equivalent on the remote
machine you probably have an alias configured that adds the option
<code>--color=yes</code> or <code>--color=auto</code>.

<p>You should remove that alias and ensure that a new login <em>does not</em>
display the output of <code>ls</code> in color. If you still cannot use
filename completion, report a bug to the <small>TRAMP</small> developers.

</p><li>File name completion does not work in large directories

<p><small>TRAMP</small> uses globbing for some operations.  (Globbing means to use the
shell to expand wildcards such as `*.c'.)  This might create long
command lines, especially in directories with many files.  Some shell
choke on long command lines, or don't cope well with the globbing
itself.

<p>If you have a large directory on the remote end, you may wish to execute
a command like <code>ls -d * ..?* &gt; /dev/null</code> and see if it hangs. 
Note that you must first start the right shell, which might be
<code>/bin/sh</code>, <code>ksh</code> or <code>bash</code>, depending on which
of those supports tilde expansion.

</p><li>What kinds of systems does <small>TRAMP</small> work on

<p><small>TRAMP</small> really expects the remote system to be a Unix-like system.  The
local system should preferably be Unix-like, as well, but <small>TRAMP</small> might
work on NT with some tweaking.

<h1>The inner workings of remote version control</h1>

<p>Unlike EFS and ange-ftp, <small>TRAMP</small> has full shell access to the remote
machine. This makes it possible to provide version control for files
accessed under <small>TRAMP</small>.

<p>The actual version control binaries must be installed on the remote
machine, accessible in the directories specified in
<var>tramp-remote-path</var>.

<p>This transparent integration with the version control systems is one of
the most valuable features provided by <small>TRAMP</small>, but it is far from perfect. 
Work is ongoing to improve the transparency of the system.

<h2>Determining if a file is under version control</h2>

<p>The VC package uses the existence of on-disk revision control master
files to determine if a given file is under revision control. These file
tests happen on the remote machine through the standard <small>TRAMP</small> mechanisms.

Up:<a rel=up href="#Version%20Control">Version Control</a>
<br>

<h2>Executing the version control commands on the remote machine</h2>

<p>There are no hooks provided by VC to allow intercepting of the version
control command execution. The calls occur through the
<code>call-process</code> mechanism, a function that is somewhat more
efficient than the <code>shell-command</code> function but that does not
provide hooks for remote execution of commands.

<p>To work around this, the functions <code>vc-do-command</code> and
<code>vc-simple-command</code> have been advised to intercept requests for
operations on files accessed via <small>TRAMP</small>.

<p>In the case of a remote file, the <code>shell-command</code> interface is
used, with some wrapper code, to provide the same functionality on the
remote machine as would be seen on the local machine.

<br>

<h2>Detecting if the working file has changed</h2>

<p>As there is currently no way to get access to the mtime of a file on a
remote machine in a portable way, the <code>vc-workfile-unchanged-p</code>
function is advised to call an <small>TRAMP</small> specific function for remote files.

<p>The <code>tramp-vc-workfile-unchanged-p</code> function uses the functioning VC
diff functionality to determine if any changes have occurred between the
workfile and the version control master.

<p>This requires that a shell command be executed remotely, a process that
is notably heavier-weight than the mtime comparison used for local
files. Unfortunately, unless a portable solution to the issue is found,
this will remain the cost of remote version control.

<h2>Bringing the workfile out of the repository</h2>

<p>VC will, by default, check for remote files and refuse to act on them
when checking out files from the repository. To work around this
problem, the function <code>vc-checkout</code> knows about <small>TRAMP</small> files and
allows version control to occur.

<h3>How VC determines who owns a workfile</h3>

<p>Emacs provides the <code>user-full-name</code> function to return the login name
of the current user as well as mapping from arbitrary user id values
back to login names. The VC code uses this functionality to map from the
uid of the owner of a workfile to the login name in some circumstances.

<p>This will not, for obvious reasons, work if the remote system has a
different set of logins. As such, it is necessary to delegate to the
remote machine the job of determining the login name associated with a
uid.

<p>Unfortunately, with the profusion of distributed management systems such
as <code>NIS</code>, <code>NIS+</code> and <code>NetInfo</code>, there is no simple,
reliable and portable method for performing this mapping.

<p>Thankfully, the only place in the VC code that depends on the mapping of
a uid to a login name is the <code>vc-file-owner</code> function. This returns
the login of the owner of the file as a string.

<p>This function has been advised to use the output of <code>ls</code> on the
remote machine to determine the login name, delegating the problem of
mapping the uid to the login to the remote system which should know more
about it than I do.

<h3>How VC determines what release your RCS is</h3>

<p>VC needs to know what release your revision control binaries you are
running as not all features VC supports are available with older
versions of <code>rcs(1)</code>, <code>cvs(1)</code> or <code>sccs(1)</code>.

<p>The default implementation of VC determines this value the first time it
is needed and then stores the value globally to avoid the overhead of
executing a process and parsing it's output each time the information is
needed.

<p>Unfortunately, life is not quite so easy when remote version control
comes into the picture. Each remote machine may have a different version
of the version control tools and, while this is painful, we need to
ensure that unavailable features are not used remotely.

<p>To resolve this issue, <small>TRAMP</small> currently takes the sledgehammer
approach of making the release values of the revision control tools
local to each <small>TRAMP</small> buffer, forcing VC to determine these values
again each time a new file is visited.

<p>This has, quite obviously, some performance implications. Thankfully,
most of the common operations performed by VC do not actually require
that the remote version be known. This makes the problem far less
apparent.

<p>Eventually these values will be captured by <small>TRAMP</small> on a system by
system basis and the results cached to improve performance.

<h2>Breaking a path into it's components.</h2>

<p><small>TRAMP</small> filenames are somewhat different, obviously, to ordinary path
names. As such, the lisp functions <code>file-name-directory</code> and
<code>file-name-nondirectory</code> are overridden within the <small>TRAMP</small> package.

<p>Their replacements are reasonably simplistic in their approach. They
dissect the filename, call the original handler on the remote path and
then rebuild the <small>TRAMP</small> path with the result.

<p>This allows the platform specific hacks in the original handlers to take
effect while preserving the <small>TRAMP</small> path information.

<h1>Debatable Issues and What Was Decided</h1>

<ul>
<li>The uuencode method does not always work.

<p>Due to the design of <small>TRAMP</small>, the encoding and decoding programs need to
read from stdin and write to stdout.  On some systems, <code>uudecode -o
-</code> will read stdin and write the decoded file to stdout, on other
systems <code>uudecode -p</code> does the same thing.  But some systems have
uudecode implementations which cannot do this at all--it is not
possible to call these uudecode implementations with suitable parameters
so that they write to stdout.

<p>Of course, this could be circumvented: the <code>begin foo 644</code> line
could be rewritten to put in some temporary file name, then
<code>uudecode</code> could be called, then the temp file could be printed and
deleted.

<p>But I have decided that this is too fragile to reliably work, so on some
systems you'll have to do without the uuencode methods.

</p><li><small>TRAMP</small> does not work on XEmacs 20.

<p>This is because it requires the macro <code>with-timeout</code> which does not
appear to exist in XEmacs 20.  I'm somewhat reluctant to add an
emulation macro to <small>TRAMP</small>, but if somebody who uses XEmacs 20 steps
forward and wishes to implement and test it, please contact me or the
mailing list.
