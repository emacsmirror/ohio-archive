;;; Commentary:

;; This program will find duplicate words in sentences.  For example,
;; in the sentence `The the cat sat on the mat', it will notice that
;; you have written `the the' and highlight the two identical words.
;; To check a region, use `M-x dw-check-region', or use `M-x
;; dw-check-to-end' to check from the current point to the end of the
;; buffer.  When you find a duplicate word, if you press `n' to exit,
;; point is left at the beginning of the first word, and mark at the
;; start of the second.

;; Some solutions to this have already been sent to the Emacs newsgroups e.g. 
;; http://x8.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=118205039&fmt=raw
;; http://x8.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=118375212&fmt=raw

;; The advantage of this approach is that it also tells you when you
;; have used the same word further on in the same sentence.  Set
;; `dw-forward-words' to 1 if you wish to find only duplicate words
;; that are immediately next to each other.  Or, if you want to check
;; for duplicate words within three words of each other, set it to 3.
;; If you want to check for duplicate words anywhere within a
;; sentence, set dw-forward-words to a negative value.  Duplicate
;; occurences of common words within a sentence but not adjacent can
;; be ignored by including the word in `dw-ignore-list'.

;;; How it works.

;; For each sentence, a list of the words in it is created.  The
;; position of each word in the buffer is stored using the text
;; property `dw-pos'.  When we find duplicate words in the sentence,
;; the text property is used to highlight the duplicate words in the
;; buffer.

;;; Developed on Emacs 20.2, but tested also on Emacs 19.34 and XEmacs 19.15.

;;; Bugs / To do:

;; Works only in text-based modes, such as Text, LaTeX, since it
;; relies on defuns such as `forward-sentence'.

;; Doesn't finish cleanly if the final sentence is not complete.

;; This code is new, so I'm sure there are lots of bugs!
