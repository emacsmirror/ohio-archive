;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package saves a file with various variables (defaults to all history
;; variables and rings) and registers at the end of each Emacs session, the
;; file is loaded at the beginning of the next session.  A special variable
;; contains the last changed files with their places (point, mark, ...); each
;; time you visit such a file, its places are restored.  Under XEmacs, you also
;; get two File submenus (for the last recently opened and changed files) and
;; an Edit submenus for the last recently killed strings (also on C-button3).

;; As you have probably already noticed, this package is a kind of extended
;; desktop "on demand".  Thus, you probably want to use just one, either
;; session or desktop (see == Alternatives, Related Packages == below).

;; Bug fixes, bug reports, improvements, and suggestions for the NEWEST VERSION
;; are strongly appreciated.  Please check the newest version first:
;;   http://www.fmi.uni-passau.de/~wedler/session/changes.html

;;; What is saved across sessions? ===========================================

;; This packages induces Emacs to save a session file (`session-save-file' is
;; "~/.session") before exiting, the file is loaded at the beginning of the
;; next Emacs session.  It does not save this file if you exit with C-0 C-x C-c
;; instead of simply C-x C-c.

;; The session file sets some global variables (`session-globals-regexp'
;; matches all history variables and rings).  Typically, these are variables
;; which are changed during some editing operations; you should not use it to
;; customize your Emacs (package custom is the appropriate choice for this).  A
;; special global variable, which is included in `session-globals-include',
;; stores some file/buffer places, see below.

;; Only variables which are non-empty lists are saved.  The list can be
;; truncated (`session-globals-max-size' is 50).  If there are equal elements
;; in the list, only the first is saved, long string elements can be dropped
;; (`session-globals-max-string' is 1024), non-printable/readable elements
;; (e.g. in `command-history') are simply dropped (no error!).

;; All registers in `session-registers' are also saved, dropping registers
;; containing long texts (`session-registers-max-string' is 1024).  To make
;; sense of this feature across sessions, the following feature is provided: if
;; a buffer is killed and some register contains a marker pointing in this
;; buffer, the register contents is changed to a file reference (this feature
;; is part of newer Emacs/XEmacs'en: `register-swap-out').

;;; Which places are stored for which buffers? ===============================

;; If you kill a buffer (this includes exiting Emacs) and the buffer is
;; visiting a file, some places are stored.  Theses places are restored if the
;; corresponding file is visited the next time.

;; Places (see `session-file-alist') are point, mark, the position of the last
;; change, the boundaries of the narrowed part (if it exists), and a permanent
;; flag (see below).  Some local variables (`session-locals-include' contains
;; `overwrite-mode') are also stored.  You should not add variables to this
;; list which are more appropriate for local variables in files, i.e.,
;; variables which are related to the contents of the file, e.g. `major-mode'.

;; By default, the places for a buffer are only stored if the buffer is
;; visiting a readable file and if the buffer is marked as permanent or if it
;; passes some tests: the mode/name test (e.g., for not storing places of gnus
;; buffers, see `session-auto-store') and the undo test (for not storing places
;; of buffers which have not been changed, see `session-undo-check').

;; The default is not used if the buffer is killed with an prefix argument
;; which is not 1 (`session-kill-buffer-commands' contains `kill-this-buffer',
;; but not `kill-buffer').  The prefix argument to this command has a special
;; meaning: ARG=3 or higher marks the buffer as permanent, a negative argument
;; resets the permanent mark.  Additionally, the buffer places are always
;; stored if the prefix argument is 2 or higher, it is never stored if it is 0
;; or lower.  See `session-store-buffer-places'.

;;; Key bindings, Menus (XEmacs only): =======================================

;; With the default installation (see `session-initialize'), this package adds
;; the following menus to the menubar of XEmacs:
;;  * "File >> Open...recently changed" to visit files with stored places,
;;  * "File >> Open...recently opened" to visit files in `file-name-history',
;;  * "Edit >> Yank...recently killed" to insert strings from `kill-ring'.

;; The default installation also adds the following bindings under XEmacs:
;;  * "C-x C-/" or "C-x undo" calls `session-jump-to-last-change' (jumps to
;;    positions of ARG'th last change, including that from the last session),
;;  * "C-button3" pops up the menu "Edit >> Yank...recently killed".

;;; Alternatives, Related Packages: ==========================================

;; Packages which maintain an alist (FILENAME . PLACES), set by kill-buffer,
;; used by find-file [method which is used by this package]:
;;  * XEMACS/packages/recent-files: maintain menu of recently opened files. [No
;;    places, menu has permanent/non-permanent entries.]
;;  * EMACS+XEMACS/packages/saveplace: automatically save place in
;;    files. [Just saves point.]
;;  * LCD/misc/context: Save some context from previous editing sessions.
;;    [Little extension to saveplace: function to load the last N visited
;;    files.]

;; Packages which load all files on startup which have been visited when ending
;; the last emacs session [too slow for me]:
;;  * EMACS/desktop: save partial status of Emacs when killed. [Also saves some
;;    global and local variables, point, mark...probably the best package in
;;    this category.]  Extension "aging" by desktop-phase.
;;  * revive: similar to desktop.  [Is included in windows, see below.]
;;  * XEMACS/packages/saveconf: Save Emacs buffer and window configuration
;;    between editing sessions. [By default, just load the packages which were
;;    visible before ending the last session.]
;;  * LCD/as-is/misc/new-saveconf: Enhanced saveconf. [Add-on & Patch]
;;  * LCD/packages/em-config: Save and restore Emacs configurations between
;;    sessions. [Additional treatment of window configurations] see below
;;  * LCD/misc/tinydesk: Saves/restores files of emacs session [``only
;;    filenames are read/saved'', fancy messages]

;; Packages which are quite restricted in its usage:
;;  * XEMACS/utils/savehist: Saves/restores just some history variables.
;;  * LCD/misc/tinyhist: Saves/restores just the command history.

;; Packages which deal with window configuration [not included--TODO]:
;;  * XEMACS/hyperbole/wconfig: Saves and yanks from save ring of window
;;    configurations.
;;  * windows: Save/restore frame & window configurations.  [Comes with revive,
;;    see above.]
;;  * LCD/as-is/win-config: Save/restore window configurations.
;;  * LCD/epoch/epoch-config: Save and restore Epoch screen/window
;;    configuration.
;;  * LCD/misc/wicos: Save and restore multiple window configurations (wicos)
;;    within emacs.
;;  * LCD/misc/escreen: emacs window session manager
;;  * LCD/packages/em-config: Save and restore Emacs configurations between
;;    sessions.

;;; Todo: ====================================================================

;; The features of this package and package desktop are probably not different
;; enough to justify two different packages.  Thus, a merge would be useful.
;; Since package desktop was created earlier, it should be done by integrating
;; the features of this package into desktop (idea from Richard Stallman) and
;; have an option whether old files get visited when Emacs starts.  I don't
;; have time for the integration anymore, but if you are interested, feel free
;; do so.

;; Todo/Ideas for the "new" desktop:
;;  * Using contexts for buffer positions (idea from bookmark and vc).
;;  * Define common code with bookmark to restore buffers from a
;;    file-representation (for files, dired, info buffers).
;;  * Saving window-configurations?

;;; Installation: ============================================================

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'session)
;;   (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'session-initialize)

;; To customize, use `M-x customize-group RET session RET' or the custom menus
;; (Emacs->Data->Session).

;; If you want to use both desktop and session, use:
;;   (setq desktop-globals-to-save '(desktop-missing-file-warning))

;;; Code:

(provide 'session)
(require 'cl)
(require 'custom)
