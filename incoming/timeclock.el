;;; Commentary:

;; This mode is for keeping track of time intervals.  You can use it
;; for whatever purpose you like, but the typical scenario is to keep
;; track of how much time you spend working on certain projects.
;;
;; Use `timeclock-in' when you start on a project, and `timeclock-out'
;; when you're done.  Once you've collected some data, you can use
;; `timeclock-workday-remaining' to see how much time is left to be
;; worked today (assuming a typical average of 8 hours a day), and
;; `timeclock-when-to-leave' which will calculate when you're free.

;; You'll probably want to bind the timeclock commands to some handy
;; keystrokes.  At the moment, C-x t is unused in Emacs 20:
;;
;;   (require 'timeclock)
;;
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map "ti" 'timeclock-in)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map "to" 'timeclock-out)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map "tc" 'timeclock-change)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map "tr" 'timeclock-reread-log)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map "tu" 'timeclock-update-modeline)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map "tw" 'timeclock-when-to-leave-string)

;; If you want Emacs to display the amount of time "left" to your
;; workday in the modeline, you can either set the value of
;; `timeclock-modeline-display' to t using M-x customize, or you
;; can add this code to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'timeclock)
;;   (timeclock-modeline-display)
;;
;; To cancel this modeline display at any time, just call
;; `timeclock-modeline-display' again.

;; You may also want Emacs to ask you before exiting, if you are
;; current working on a project.  This can be done either by setting
;; `timeclock-ask-before-exiting' to t using M-x customize (this is
;; the default), or by adding the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook 'timeclock-query-out)

;; NOTE: If you change your .timelog file without using timeclock's
;; functions, or if you change the value of any of timeclock's
;; customizable variables, you should run the command
;; `timeclock-reread-log'.  This will recompute any discrepancies in
;; your average working time, and will make sure that the various
;; display functions return the correct value.
