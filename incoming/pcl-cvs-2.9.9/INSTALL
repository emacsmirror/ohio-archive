PCL-CVS requires parts of the Elib library, version 1.0 or later.  Elib
can be downloaded from either the primary GNU FTP site at
<URL:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/>, or from any number of other
mirror sites.  Get Elib, and install it, before proceeding.  It's
probably also available from where you downloaded PCL-CVS, including
from <URL:ftp://rum.cs.yale.edu/pub/monnier/pcl-cvs/elib-1.0.tar.gz>.


Installation of the program
===========================

 -1. Download and install the Elib library (if it's not done yet).

  0. If you're using XEmacs, you probably need Emacs' easy-mmode.el that
     you can find at <URL:ftp://rum.cs.yale.edu/pub/monnier/pcl-cvs/>.
     Copy it into the pcl-cvs source dir (it's only needed for compiling
     the .el files).  Also, don't forget to first install the Elib library.

  1. Edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your site.
     The only things you have to change is the definition of `lispdir'
     (usually `/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp' or something similar)
     and `infodir' (usually `/usr/local/(share/)info' or similar).  The
     compiled elisp files will be copied to `lispdir', and the info
     files to `infodir'.

  2. Make sure you have already installed the Elib library.

  3. Type `make install' in the source directory.  This will
     byte-compile all `.el' files and copy all the `.elc' files into the
     directory you specified in step 1.  It will also copy the info
     files (and add a corresponding entry to the info-dir file if
     install-info can be found).

     If you want to install the `.el' files as well, just type
     `make install_el'.

     If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but don't
     want to install them, you can type `make elcfiles' instead.

  4. Edit the file `site-start.el' (or default.el) in your emacs lisp
     directory ((i.e. the one specified above) and enter the
     contents of the file `pcl-cvs-startup.el' into it.  It contains
     a couple of `autoload's that facilitates the use of pcl-cvs.
     Alternatively, you can just use `make install_startup'.

  5. If you already had copied the pcl-cvs.startup.el file to your
     site-start.el, you might want to check if it is still correct since
     autoloads might have been added/removed.

How to make typeset documentation
=================================

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset
manual from `pcl-cvs.texi' by typing ``make pcl-cvs.dvi''.  If you
prefer a postscript version of this file, just use ``make pcl-cvs.ps''.
