1. With what version of Emacs does PCL-CVS work ?

  PCL-CVS should work with any recent (X)Emacs as well as on NTEmacs.
  "recent" means something like "from 19.34 onward".  It might work with earlier
  Emacsen, but if it doesn't we don't necessarily consider it as a bug.


2. Faces don't quite work with Emacs-19.34

  This is because 19.34 has an old version of custom.el which PCL-CVS
  works around by disabling some of its code.  You can try installing
  a newer version of custom.el from http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/
  or you can set up the faces in your own .emacs file.


3. The TeXinfo document seems out-of-date and/or unclear !

  Well spotted!  Please tell us what parts are outdated and give us
  some sample replacement text for the unclear parts.


4. How can I use Customize on Emacs 19.34 ?

  The customize package bundled with 19.34 is out-dated and PCL-CVS
  is only careful to work around it.  If you want better support, download
  and install a newer customize from http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~abraham/custom/


5. PCL-CVS gives me error messages about files with '/' !

  It hopefully also mentioned to consult this file.  If it didn't, it's a bug.
  Now the reason for that message goes as follows:  cvs-1.10 has a new
  feature used by PCL-CVS which allows to reduce the number of executions of
  the cvs command.  Sadly, this feature depends on the cvs server rather than
  the cvs client, so even if you have a cvs-1.10 for client, you might need to
  disable this feature.  To disable this feature, add thje following in your
  .emacs (after complaining to the administrator of the repository):

	(setq cvs-execute-single-dir t)

  If you later on stop using that "old" repository or if the repository's
  server gets updated, it is recommanded to remove the above line from
  your .emacs in order to enjoy zippier interaction.


6. I put `cvs-status-cvstrees' in `cvs-status-mode-hook' but it doesn't work !

  This is usually due to the fact that `cvs-status-mode' is called when
  the *cvs-info* buffer is created, at which point the buffer is empty.
  If you want to run something that depends on the output of CVS, you
  want to put it in the fourth element of `cvs-buffer-name-alist':

	(add-to-list 'cvs-buffer-name-alist
	  '("status" "*cvs-info*" cvs-status cvs-status-cvstrees))

  This will make sure that `cvs-status-cvstrees' is only run once
  CVS is done.


7. I get complaints about `easy-mmode-define-minor-mode' !

  XEmacs does not provide easy-minor-mode.  You have to use Emacs'
  version of it.  You can find a copy at
  <URL:ftp://rum.cs.yale.edu/pcl-cvs/easy-mmode.el>.  Copy it into the
  directory and then retry the compilation (the package is only needed
  for compiling the .el files).


8. I get `conflict' for a file that should say `need-merge'.

  Earlier CVS versions had an ambiguous output when run with
  `cvs -n update'.  There's nothing PCL-CVS can do about that.  Upgrade
  (the CVS server) to the latest CVS and the problem should disappear.


NN. My problem was not answered by this FAQ!

  Maybe it will be answered by the BUGS file.  Else, you can always
  send your gripes to the PCL-CVS mailing-list: pcl-cvs@cyclic.com.
