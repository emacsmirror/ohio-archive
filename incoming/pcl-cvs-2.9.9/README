PCL-CVS is a front-end to CVS.  It integrates the most
frequently used CVS commands into emacs.

For VC users, PCL-CVS can be thought of as a VC-dired specially designed
for CVS.  PCL-CVS is not a replacement for VC and is supposed to interact well
with it.  It provides a global view of your project and allows execution
of cvs commands on several files at a time.

This release of PCL-CVS requires Elib version 1.0 or newer.  Elib is no
longer distributed with PCL-CVS, since that caused too much confusion.
You can get Elib from <URL:ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/emacs/elib-1.0.tar.gz>,
or of course from any GNU FTP mirror site.  You might also find a copy
of Elib where you found this copy of PCL-CVS (see below for the primary
site).

You might also want to check out some other `recommended' packages which
are not necessary for PCL-CVS, but will probably prove useful:
- VC (bundled with Emacs) provides access to CVS commands from a file's buffer,
  which is sometimes more convenient than going back to PCL-CVS' buffer.
- diff-mode (used to be part of PCL-CVS) to better use `cvs diff' output.
  Can be found at <URL:ftp://rum.cs.yale.edu/pub/monnier/misc>
- simple-merge-mode allows a very light weight support for resolving
  conflicts.  It can be found at the same place as diff-mode.

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

Full (but not up-to-date) documentation is in pcl-cvs.texi.
A preformatted info file is also included (pcl-cvs.info).

If you have been using a previous version of PCL-CVS (for instance
1.02 which is distributed with CVS 1.3) you should read through the
file NEWS to see what has changed.

Up-to-date versions of this package can be found here:
