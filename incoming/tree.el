;;; Description:

;;  tree.el allows lisp coders to display and control
;; the use of tree structures within buffers.
;;
;;  To use the tree you need only define the original nodes
;; that are to be inserted upon startup, and define a function
;; which will be called to insert children when branches are
;; expanded.
;;
;;  For example a simple directory browser can be written
;; using the following function, and sample code:
;;
;;  ; Function to be called when a node is expanded. 
;; (defun dired-root-expand (node)
;;   (let ((dirs nil))
;;     (if (file-directory-p (car node))
;; 	(progn
;; 	  (setq dirs (directory-files (car node)))
;; 	  (setq dirs (delete "." dirs))
;; 	  (setq dirs (delete ".." dirs))
;; 	  )
;;    dirs)))
;;
;;  ; Test code
;;  (progn
;;   (pop-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Poor Mans Dired*"))
;;   (erase-buffer)
;;   (setq tree-root-nodes (list "/"))
;;   (tree-create tree-root-nodes 'dired-root-expand t)
;;   (local-set-key " " 'tree-toggle-branch)
;;  )
