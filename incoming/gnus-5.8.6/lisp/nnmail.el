If you'd like, for instance, one mail group for mail from the

else, you could do something like this:

       '((\"mail.4ad\" \"From:.*4ad\")

As you can see, this variable is a list of lists, where the first
element in each \"rule\" is the name of the group (which, by the way,
does not have to be called anything beginning with \"mail\",
\"yonka.zow\" is a fine, fine name), and the second is a regexp that
nnmail will try to match on the header to find a fit.

The second element can also be a function.  In that case, it will be
called narrowed to the headers with the first element of the rule as
the argument.  It should return a non-nil value if it thinks that the
mail belongs in that group.

The last element should always have \"\" as the regexp.

This variable can also have a function as its value."

  "Incoming mail can be split according to this fancy variable.
To enable this, set `nnmail-split-methods' to `nnmail-split-fancy'.

The format of this variable is SPLIT, where SPLIT can be one of
the following:

GROUP: Mail will be stored in GROUP (a string).

\(FIELD VALUE [- RESTRICT [- RESTRICT [...]]] SPLIT): If the message
  field FIELD (a regexp) contains VALUE (a regexp), store the messages 
  as specified by SPLIT.  If RESTRICT (a regexp) matches some string
  after FIELD and before the end of the matched VALUE, return NIL,
  otherwise process SPLIT.  Multiple RESTRICTs add up, further
  restricting the possibility of processing SPLIT.

\(| SPLIT...): Process each SPLIT expression until one of them matches.
  A SPLIT expression is said to match if it will cause the mail
  message to be stored in one or more groups.

\(& SPLIT...): Process each SPLIT expression.

\(: FUNCTION optional args): Call FUNCTION with the optional args, in
  the buffer containing the message headers.  The return value FUNCTION
  should be a split, which is then recursively processed.

\(! FUNCTION SPLIT): Call FUNCTION with the result of SPLIT.  The
  return value FUNCTION should be a split, which is then recursively
  processed.

FIELD must match a complete field name.  VALUE must match a complete
word according to the `nnmail-split-fancy-syntax-table' syntax table.
You can use \".*\" in the regexps to match partial field names or words.

FIELD and VALUE can also be lisp symbols, in that case they are expanded
as specified in `nnmail-split-abbrev-alist'.

GROUP can contain \\& and \\N which will substitute from matching
\\(\\) patterns in the previous VALUE.

Example:

\(setq nnmail-split-methods 'nnmail-split-fancy
      nnmail-split-fancy
