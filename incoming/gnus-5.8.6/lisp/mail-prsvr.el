;;; Commentary:

;;; Code:

(defvar mail-parse-charset nil
  "Default charset used by low-level libraries.
This variable should never be set.  Instead, it should be bound by
functions that wish to call mail-parse functions and let them know
what the desired charset is to be.")

(defvar mail-parse-mule-charset nil
  "Default MULE charset used by low-level libraries.
This variable should never be set.")

(defvar mail-parse-ignored-charsets nil
  "Ignored charsets used by low-level libraries.
This variable should never be set.  Instead, it should be bound by
functions that wish to call mail-parse functions and let them know
what the desired charsets is to be ignored.")
