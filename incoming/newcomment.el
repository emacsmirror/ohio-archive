;;; Commentary:

;;; History:

;;; Bugs:

;; - single-char nestable comment-start can only do the "\\s<+" stuff
;;   if the corresponding closing marker happens to be right.
;; - C-u C-u comment-region in TeXinfo generates bogus comments @ccccc@
;; - the code assumes that bol is outside of any comment/string.
;; - uncomment-region with a numeric argument can render multichar
;;   comment markers invalid.

;;; Todo:

;; - extract comment data from the syntax-table
;; - maybe do the opposite as well (set the syntax-table from other data)
;; - spill auto-fill of comments onto the end of the next line
;; - uncomment-region with a consp (for blocks) or somehow make the
;;   deletion of continuation markers less dangerous
;; - drop block-comment-<foo> unless it's really used
;; - uncomment-region on a part of a comment
;; - obey the numarg of uncomment-region for continuation markers

;;; Change Log:
;; $Log: newcomment.el,v $
;; Revision 1.6  1999/12/08 00:19:51  monnier
;; various fixes and gratuitous movements.
;;
;; Revision 1.5  1999/11/30 16:20:55  monnier
;; (comment-style(s)): Replaces comment-extra-lines (and comment-multi-line).
;; (comment-use-syntax): Whether to use the syntax-table or just the regexps.
;; (comment-end-skip): To find the end of the text.
;; ...
;;
;; Revision 1.4  1999/11/29 01:31:47  monnier
;; (comment-find): New function.
;; (indent-for-comment, set-comment-column, kill-comment): use it.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  1999/11/29 00:49:18  monnier
;; (kill-comment): Fixed by rewriting it with syntax-tables rather than regexps
;; (comment-normalize-vars): Set default (cdr comment-continue)
;; (comment-end-quote-re): new function taken out of `comment-region-internal'
;; (uncomment-region): Rewritten using syntax-tables.  Also unquotes
;;   nested comment-ends and eliminates continuation markers.
;; (comment-region-internal): Don't create a default for cce.
;;   Use `comment-end-quote-re'.
;;
;; Revision 1.2  1999/11/28 21:33:55  monnier
;; (comment-make-extra-lines): Moved out of comment-region-internal.
;; (comment-with-narrowing): New macro.  Provides a way to preserve
;;   indentation inside narrowing.
;; (comment-region-internal): Add "\n" to close the comment if necessary.
;;   Correctly handle commenting-out when BEG is not bolp.
;;
;; Revision 1.1  1999/11/28 18:51:06  monnier
;; First "working" version:
;; - uncomment-region doesn't work for some unknown reason
;; - comment-multi-line allows the use of multi line comments
;; - comment-extra-lines allows yet another style choice
;; - comment-add allows to default to `;;'
;; - comment-region on a comment calls uncomment-region
;; - C-u C-u comment-region aligns comment end markers
;; - C-u C-u C-u comment-region puts the comment inside a rectangle
;; - comment-region will try to quote comment-end markers inside the region
;; - comment-start markers are placed at the indentation level
;;
