;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Since I'm currently working on testing an LDAP server, I needed
;; (well wanted) some routines to look up people on the server and
;; return me their email addresses.
;;
;; It currently relies on having the "ldapsearch" executable in your
;; path (it's part of the Uni of Michigan LDAP stuff, which you can
;; find at http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/ldap/)
;;
;;; TO DO:
;;
;; - Allow choosing of LDAP server at search time or search one after
;;   another.
;; - Allow searching on more than just CN, and look for more than just
;;   mail addresses (partly done, although we still only search for
;;   people and one of their attributes)
;; - Maybe write our own ldap connection routines ?
;; - Better error handling :P
;;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;;; History:
;;
;; 0.01 - Initial version
;; 0.02 - Use ldap-host-info to allow use of more than one LDAP
;;        service.
;;      - Make ldap-do-search a bit more generic (you can now specify
;;        the attribute you're after, as well as the attribute name of
;;        the search key).
;; 0.03 - GPL'ed it.
;;      - Added completing read for ldap server when you pass a
;;        prefix-arg to the two interactive routines.
;; 0.04 - If there's more than one match, prompt the user to pick one.
