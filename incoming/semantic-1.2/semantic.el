;;; Commentary:
;;
;; API for determining semantic content of a buffer.  The mode using
;; semantic must be a deterministic programming language.
;;
;; The output of a semantic bovine parse is parse tree.  While it is
;; possible to assign actions in the bovine-table in a similar fashion
;; to bison, this is not it's end goal.
;;
;; Bovine Table Tips & Tricks:
;; ---------------------------
;;
;; Many of the tricks needed to create rules in bison or yacc can be
;; used here.  The exceptions to this rule are that there is no need to
;; declare bison tokens, and you cannot put "code" in the middle of a
;; match rule.  In addition, you should avoid empty matching rules as
;; I haven't quite gotten those to be reliable yet.
;;
;; The top-level bovine table is an association list of all the rules
;; needed to parse your language, or language segment.  It is easiest
;; to create one master rule file, and call the semantic bovinator on
;; subsections passing down the nonterminal rule you want to match.
;;
;; Thus, every entry in the bovine table is of the form:
;; ( NONTERMINAL-SYMBOL MATCH-LIST )
;; 
;; The nonterminal symbol is equivalent to the bison RESULT, and the
;; MATCH-LIST is equivalent to the bison COMPONENTS.  Thus, the bison
;; rule:
;;        expseq: expseq1
;;              | expseq2
;;              ;
;; becomes:
;;        ( expseq ( expseq1 ) ( expseq2 ) )
;; which defines RESULT expseq which can be either COMPONENT expseq1
;; or expseq2.  These two table entries also use nonterminal results,
;; and also use the DEFAULT RESULT LAMBDA (see below for details on
;; the RESULT LAMBDA).
;;
;; You can also have recursive rules, as in bison.  For example the
;; bison rule:
;;        expseq1: exp
;;               | expseq1 ',' exp
;;               ;
;; becomes:
;;        (expseq1 (exp)
;;                 (expseq1 punctuation "," exp
;;                          (lambda (val start end)
;;                                  ( -generator code- ))))
;;
;; This time, the second rule uses it's own RESULT LAMBDA.
;;
;; Lastly, you can also have STRING LITERALS in your rules, though
;; these are different from Bison.  As can be seen above, a literal is
;; a constant lexed symbol, such as `punctuation', followed by a string
;; which is a *regular expression* which must match, or this rule will
;; fail.
;;
;; In BISON, a given rule can have inline ACTIONS.  In the semantic
;; bovinator, there can be only one ACTION which I will refer to here
;; as the RESULT LAMBDA.  There are two default RESULT LAMBDAs which
;; can be used which cover the default case.  The RESULT LAMBDA must
;; return a valid nonterminal token.  A nonterminal token is always of the
;; form ( NAME TOKEN VALUE1 VALUE2 ... START END).  NAME is the name
;; to use for this token.  It is first so that a list of tokens is
;; also an alist, or completion table.  Token should be the same
;; symbol as the nonterminal token generated, though it does not have to
;; be.  The values can be anything you want, including other tokens.
;; START and END indicate where in the buffer this token is, and is
;; easily derived from the START and END parameter passed down.
;;
;; A RESULT LAMBDA must take three parameters, VALS, START and END.
;; VALS is the list of literals derived during the bovination of the
;; match list, including punctuation, parens, and explicit
;; matches.  other elements
;;
;; Here are some example match lists and their code:
;;
;; (expression (lambda (vals start end)
;;                     (append (car vals) (list start end))))
;;
;; In this RESULT LAMBDA, VALS will be of length one, and it's first
;; element will contain the nonterminal expression result.  It is
;; likely to use a rule like this when there is a top level nonterminal
;; symbol whose contents are several other single nonterminal rules.
;; Because of this, we want to result that value with our START and END
;; appended.
;;
;; NOTE: nonterminal values passed in as VALS always have their
;;       START/END parts stripped!
;;
;; This example lambda is also one of the DEFAULT lambdas for the case
;; of a single nonterminal result.  Thus, the above rule could also be
;; written as (expression).
;;
;; A more complex example uses more flex elements.  Lets match this:
;;
;;    (defun myfunction (arguments) "docstring" ...)
;;
;; If we assume a flex depth of 1, we can write it this way:
;;
;; (open-paren "(" symbol "defun" symbol semantic-list string
;;             (lambda (vals start end)
;;                     (list (nth 2 vals) 'function nil (nth 3 vals)
;;                           (nth 4 vals) start end)))
;;
;; The above will create a function token, whose format is
;; predefined.  (See the symbol `semantic-toplevel-bovine-table' for
;; details on some default symbols that should be provided.)
;;
;; From this we can see that VALS will have the value:
;; ( "(" "defun" "myfunction" "(arguments)" "docstring")
;;
;; If we also want to return a list of arguments in our function
;; token, we can replace `semantic-list' with the following recursive
;; nonterminal rule.
;;
;; ( arg-list (semantic-list
;;             (lambda (vals start end)
;;                (semantic-bovinate-from-nonterminal start end 'argsyms))))
;; ( argsyms
;;   (open-paren argsyms (lambda (vals start end)
;;			   (append (car (cdr vals)) (list start end))))
;;   (symbol argsyms (lambda (vals start end)
;;		       (append (cons (car vals) (car (cdr vals)))
;;			       (list start end))))
;;   (symbol close-paren (lambda (vals start end)
;;			   (list (car vals) start end))))
;;
;; This recursive rule can find a parenthetic list with any number of
;; symbols in it.
;;
;; Here we also see a new function, `semantic-bovinate-from-nonterminal'.
;; This function takes START END and a nonterminal result symbol to
;; match.  This will return a complete token, including START and
;; END.  This function should ONLY BE USED IN A RESULT LAMBDA.  It
;; uses knowledge of that scope to reduce the number of parameters
;; that need to be passed in.  This is useful for decomposing complex
;; syntactic elements, such as semantic-list.
;;
;; Token's and the VALS argument
;; -----------------------------
;;
;; Not all syntactic tokens are represented by strings in the VALS argument
;; to the match-list lambda expression.  Some are a dotted pair (START . END).
;; The following are represented as strings:
;;  1) symbols
;;  2) punctuation
;;  3) open/close-paren
;;  4) charquote
;;  5) strings
;; The following are represented as a dotted-pair.
;;  1) semantic-list
;;  2) comments
;; Nonterminals are always lists which are generated in the lambda
;; expression.
;;
;; Semantic Bovine Table Debugger
;; ------------------------------
;;
;; The bovinator also includes a primitive debugger.  This debugger
;; walks through the parsing process and see how it's being
;; interpretted.  There are two steps in debuggin a bovine table.
;;
;; First, place the cursor in the source code where the table is
;; defined.  Execute the command `semantic-bovinate-debug-set-table'.
;; This tells the debugger where you table is.
;;
;; Next, place the cursor in a buffer you which to run the bovinator
;; on, and execute the command `semantic-bovinate-buffer-debug'.  This
;; will parse the table, and highlight the relevant areas and walk
;; through the match list with the cursor, displaying the current list
;; of values (which is always backwards.)
;;
;; DESIGN ISSUES:
;; -------------
;;
;;  At the moment, the only thing I really dislike is the RESULT
;;  LAMBDA format.  While having some good defaults is nice, the use
;;  of append and list in the lambda seems unnecessarily complex.
;;
;;  Also of issue, I am still not sure I like the idea of stripping
;;  BEGIN/END off of nonterminal tokens passed down in VALS.  While they
;;  are often unnecessary, I can imagine that they could prove useful.
;;  Only time will tell.

(defvar semantic-toplevel-bovine-table nil
  "Variable that defines how to bovinate top level items in a buffer.
Set this in your major mode to return function and variable semantic
types.

The format of a BOVINE-TABLE is:

 ( ( NONTERMINAL-SYMBOL1 MATCH-LIST1 )
   ( NONTERMINAL-SYMBOL2 MATCH-LIST2 )
   ...
   ( NONTERMINAL-SYMBOLn MATCH-LISTn )
 
Where each NONTERMINAL-SYMBOL is an artificial symbol which can appear
in any child state.  As a starting place, one of the NONTERMINAL-SYMBOLS
must be `bovine-toplevel'.

A MATCH-LIST is a list of possible matches of the form:

 ( STATE-LIST1
   STATE-LIST2
   ...
   STATE-LISTN )

where STATE-LIST is of the form:
  ( TYPE1 [ \"VALUE1\" ] TYPE2 [ \"VALUE2\" ] ... LAMBDA )

where TYPE is one of the returned types of the token stream.
VALUE is a value, or range of values to match against.  For
example, a SYMBOL might need to match \"foo\".  Some TYPES will not
have matching criteria.

LAMBDA is a lambda expression which is evaled with the text of the
type when it is found.  It is passed the list of all buffer text
elements found since the last lambda expression.  It should return a
semantic element (see below.)

For consistency between languages, always use the following symbol
forms.  It is fine to create new symbols, or to exclude some if they
do not exist, however by using these symbols, you can maximize the
number of language-independent programs available for use with your
language.

GENERIC ENTRIES:

 Bovine table entry return elements are up to the table author.  It is
recommended, however, that the following format be used.

 (\"NAME\" type-symbol [\"TYPE\"] ... \"DOCSTRING\" START END)

Where type-symbol is the type of return token found, and NAME is it's
name.  If there is any typing information needed to describe this
entry, make that come third.  Next, any additional information follows
the optional type.  The last data entry can be the position in the buffer
of DOCSTRING.  A docstring does not have to exist in the form used by
Emacs Lisp.  It could be the text of a comment appearing just before a
function call, or in line with a variable.

The last two elements must be START and END.

It may seem odd to place NAME in slot 0, and the type-symbol in slot
1, but this turns the returned elements into a list which can be used
by alist based function.  This makes it ideal for passing into generic
sorters, string completion functions, and list searching functions.

In the below entry formats, \"NAME\" is a string which is the name of
the object in question.  It is possible for this to be nil in some
situations, and code dealing with entries should try to be aware of
these situations.

\"TYPE\" is a string representing the type of some objects.  For a
variable, this could very well be another top level token representing
a type nonterminal.

TOP-LEVEL ENTRIES:

 (\"NAME\" variable \"TYPE\" CONST DEFAULT-VALUE MODIFIERS \"DOCSTRING\"
           START END)
   The definition of a variable, or constant.  CONST is a boolean representing
   if this variable is considered a constant.  DEFAULT-VALUE can be
   something apropriate such a a string, or list of parsed elements.
   MODIFIERS are details about a variable that are not covered in the TYPE
   field.  DOCSTRING is optional.

 (\"NAME\" function \"TYPE\" ( ARG-LIST ) MODIFIERS [THROWS]
          \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
   A function/procedure definition.
   ARG-LIST is a list of variable definitions.
   THROWS is an optional argument for functions or methods in languages
   that support typed signal throwing.
   DOCSTRING is optional.

 (\"NAME\" type \"TYPE\" ( PART-LIST ) ( PARENTS ) MODIFIERS
          \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
   A type definition.
   TYPE of a type could be anything, such as (in C) struct, union, typedef,
   or class.
   PART-LIST is only useful for structs that have multiple individual parts.
            (It is recommended that these be variables, functions or types).
   PARENTS is strictly for classes where there is inheritance.
   

 (\"FILE\" include SYSTEM \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
   In C, an #include statement.  In elisp, a require statement.
   Indicates additional locations of sources or definitions.
   SYSTEM is true if this include is part of a set of system includes.

 (\"NAME\" package DETAIL \"DOCSTRING\" START END)
   In Emacs Lisp, a `provide' statement.  DETAIL might be an
   associated file name.
