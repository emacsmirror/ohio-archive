1999-09-08  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* mc-gpg.el: revamp decrypt and verify parsers to handle
	gnupg-0.9.6 though 1.0.0 . Older versions have slight problems:
	unknown signators and symmetrically-encrypted messages tend to
	make mailcrypt think the message is corrupted, and some incidental
	information (keyids for unknown keys, some signature dates) is
	unavailable. Doesn't used stderr at all, barely uses the exit
	status.

1999-07-20  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp.el: Added check for PGP version mismatch when using
	PGP 2.6.

	* mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.info: Latest
	info files.

	* mc-gpg.el: Incorporated Brian Warner's Changes into GPG support.
	Specific changes are noted in his Changelog entries, below.

1999-07-18  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-toplev.el: Changed GNUS interface to look at raw
	articles. Thanks to Mr. Stainless Steel Rat.

	* configure, configure.in: Modified configure script test
	for emacs. When building Mailcrypt in a subshell of XEmacs,
	the script would get confused because XEmacs would set the
	environment variable EMACS to t. Thanks to Todd Sabin.

	* mc-gpg.el: Added catchall pattern in GPG decrypt parser to
	catch arbitrary "decryption failed" messages. This prevents
	random failure from resulting in deleted message bodies! Thanks
	to Robert Bihlmeyer.

1999-07-17  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-toplev.el: Changed rmail support so that errors do not
	leave the user in some wacky buffer.

1999-06-15  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* mc-gpg.el: update comments to reflect GPG behavior through
	0.9.7 (no code changes). Tested against 0.9.7, works ok, but
	we're not taking advantage of the new GPG status codes yet.

1999-05-25  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el: Changed message-box to message-or-box, which
	doesn't annoy as many people with that invasive message
	box. Thanks to Dave Love and Gunnar Evermann.

	* Makefile.in, mc-gpg.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el, mc-remail.el,
	mc-setversion.el: Cleaned up Makefile a bit, thanks to Francois
	Pinard. Also added some defvar's to quiet almost all of those
	pesky compiler warnings.  Thanks to Francois Pinard and to
	Dave Love.

1999-05-18  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-gpg.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Tightened regular expressions
	for matching PGP/GPG header strings only when they begin a
	line. Also improved the comment in mc-gpg.el. Thanks to Ulrik
	Dickow.

1999-04-20  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el: Changed email address parsing to use the rfc822
	library. Now extraction of recipient addresses is fully RFC
	822 compliant.

	* mc-toplev.el: Changed email address parsing to use the rfc822
	library. Now extraction of recipient addresses is fully RFC 822
	compliant. Thanks to Jack Twilley.

1999-03-28  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* mc-gpg.el: totally revamp decrypt-parser and verify-parser.
	Tested against gpg-0.4.5 and gpg-0.9.5, checked GPG output
	messages for 0.4.5 and 0.9.[012345] and these parsers should work
	with them. GPG gives better and better status messages
	(easy to parse, not locale-specific) in recent versions so I split
	out the code that needs to scan stderr for information and created
	a variable called mc-gpg-handle-pre095 (default to t) that
	controls whether to use such code or not. If gpg-1.0 comes out and
	everyone uses it and never uses old crufty versions, then this
	will make it easier to rip that code out and have a much cleaner
	set of parsers.

1999-03-24  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* mc-gpg.el (mc-gpg-verify-parser): cleanup, handle all gpg from 0.4.5
	through 0.9.5, if the message is signed by an unknown key, get the
	keyid efficiently and safely from gpg-0.9.5, else pull it from a
	stderr message [less safe]

1999-03-23  Brian Warner  <warner@lothar.com>

	* mc-gpg.el (mc-gpg-insert-parser): if rc != 0, don't insert
	anything, and return error information instead of erroring
	out. Change all callers to deal with it. This fixes the "if we
	can't find gpg, attempting to decrypt removes all text from the
	buffer" bug.

	* mc-gpg.el (mc-gpg-null-parser): fix [unused] null parser

	* mc-gpg.el (mc-gpg-decrypt-parser): another message changed in
	gpg-0.9.3 . Changed regexp to match either old ".. Secret key not
	available" or new ".. public key not found"

1999-03-20  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* ChangeLog, mc-pgp5.el: Fixed passphrase expiration when signing
	messages. Thanks to Greg Shapiro.

1999-03-12  Gregory Neil Shapiro  <gshapiro@sendmail.org>

	* mc-pgp5.el (mc-pgp50-sign-parser): Deactivate the
	  password if mc-passwd-timeout is set to nil.

1999-03-05  Brian Warner <warner@lothar.com>

	* mc-gpg.el: Patched GPG-signing code to work correctly with
	GPG-0.9.3. Thanks to Brian Warner.

1999-03-04  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Added key-fetching to PGP 5 using the hkp
	protocol. Thanks Paul Koning!

1999-02-27  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-toplev.el: Fixed a bug in rmail support, which always
	reported the wrong "verified" status. Thanks to Gerrit Jahn.

	* mc-toplev.el: Patched GNUS support so that Mailcrypt won't dump
	users into the "raw" article buffer--though that buffer is used
	for verifying since PGP junk can be hidden in GNUS. Thanks to
	Ulrik Dickow.

	* mc-toplev.el: Fixed mh-e support so that users can view
	encrypted messages without saving them. Thanks to Andreas Eder.

	* INSTALL, mc-setversion.el: Fixed mc-setversion to use
	completing-read in a way which works with both emacs and
	XEmacs. Thanks to Robert Bihlmeyer for the patch, and to numerous
	people for reporting the bug, including Dan Girellini, and Dirk
	Husemann.

	* INSTALL: Added a warning to the INSTALL file for users of Emacs
	20.3 and higher, to install Mailcrypt correctly into rmail. Thanks
	to Tony Silva.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed out-of-turn passphrase deactivation which
	breaks mailcrypt for anyone paranoid enough to set
	mc-passwd-timeout to 0 or nil. Thanks to Gregory Neil Shapiro.

	* ChangeLog, mc-gpg.el: Lots of cleanup and improvements in the
	GPG support code. Thanks to Brian Warner.

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp5.el: Added support for key fetching under
	PGP 5.0. Many thanks to Loren J. Rittle!

	* mc-toplev.el: Removed call to (vm-select-folder-buffer) in
	mc-toplev.el. Thanks to Eric C. Newton.

	* mc-gpg.el: Fixed mc-gpg.el to avoid using with-current-buffer,
	which emacs 19 didn't have. Thanks to Brian Warner.

1998-11-26  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL, ANNOUNCE: Updated the announcement and install
	documentation. Thanks to Andreas Zell and Remi Guyomarch.

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info,
	mailcrypt.info-1, ChangeLog, LCD-entry, mailcrypt.dvi: Changed
	version information to 3.5.1 in all relevant files, preparatory to
	another release.

	* mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.info-2, mc-pgp5.el, mailcrypt.info:
	Incorporated and tested Brian W's changes to mc-pgp5.el. He
	localized a bunch of variables, cutting down on compiler
	warnings. Thanks!

	* configure.in, mailcrypt.texi, mc-gpg.el, Makefile.in,
	README.gpg, configure: Incorporated more fixes from Brian Warner
	to GPG support; cleaned up Makefile, removed Perl test from
	configure script, updated the README.gpg, and much much more.

	* README.gpg: Sync-ed with patch from Brian Warner against
	3.5b7. The change appears trivial only because his previous patch
	was faithfully applied way back when.

1998-10-19  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed bug in signing 8-bit data (including messages
	in most languages other than English!  Bad, Bad PGP 5!).  Thanks
	to Greg Steuck.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.info-2,
	mailcrypt.info: Updated "mc-setversion" documentation in the
	Mailcrypt info file.  Thanks to Adam Beck.

1998-10-16  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* configure.in, gpgwrap.pl.in, mc-gpg.el, INSTALL, Makefile.in,
	README.gpg, configure: Updated GPG support to handle GPG 0.4.1,
	and improve various aspects of mc-gpg.el.  Most notably, the
	wrapper script gpgwrap.pl is now obsolete, and Mailcrypt users are
	heartily recommended to upgrade their GPG installation--it was a
	GPG bug which necessitated the wrapper script.  Thanks to Brian
	Warner, the Official Mailcrypt GPG Wizard.

	* mc-pgp.el: Re-enabled conventional decryption in PGP 2.6 mode.
	Thanks to Roger Williams for spotting this bug.

1998-10-15  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed "bindir" in the makefile, so that gpgwrap
	gets installed in the correct place.  Thanks to Markku Kolkka.

1998-10-05  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-toplev.el: Modified mc-mh-decrypt-message to optionally turn
	off backup of MH messages.  By default, backup is enabled (for
	backward compatibility).  Use this one with caution.

1998-10-04  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mc-pgp5.el, mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.info-1:
	Fixed a "buffer bug" in which decrypting under mh-e exits with an
	error and leaves the user in some random buffer (although
	decryption succeeds).  Basically, the PGP 5.0 parsers all call
	"pop-to-buffer" near the end, which screws up the buffer history
	list.  Why on earth was "pop-to-buffer" ever used in the first
	place?

1998-09-28  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL: Fixed INSTALL documentation of "mc-setversion".

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info,
	mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.dvi, mailcrypt.el, ChangeLog,
	LCD-entry, README, ANNOUNCE: Update for release.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.info-1: Updated rmail
	documentation for Emacs 20.3, in which the rmail-mode-hook has
	changed to rmail-show-message-hook.  Thanks to Tim Steele.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.info-1,
	mailcrypt.info: Updated documentation to mention "message-mode"
	when setting up Mailcrypt for use under Gnus.  Thanks to several
	usenet posters addressing this problem, particularly Kevin
	Davidson.

	* mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Modified mc-pgp[50]-lookup-key to not
	mind a missing secret keyring.  This is useful for the paranoid
	sorts ;-) who keep their secret keyring on a floppy, and who
	usually encrypt to public keys but don't sign.  These folks can
	encrypt without their secret keyring even being on the machine in
	question.  Thanks to Steven T. Smith (usenet post, 1997/02/03).

1998-09-27  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp5.el: Applied patches which help Mailcrypt
	to run correctly with PGP 5.0i in XEmacs.  Thanks to Gunnar
	Evermann.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed the last bug in key snarfing; updated feedback
	to adhere to the current convention (list instead of cons).

1998-09-24  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Improved diagnostic messages, particularly for
	signatures.  They still don't quite match up with the old
	Mailcrypt messages, but they are a good deal better.

1998-09-23  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Encryption now handles the (bogus) case that no
	recipients are specified.  I believe that PGP 2.6.2 quietly armors
	text in that case, and perhaps we should do that.  At the moment,
	however, we trap the error condition.

	* mc-pgp5.el: There!  The last bug rooted out.  Now
	mc-pgp50-process-region works correctly with Brian Warner's key
	snarfing code.  Provisionally, key snarfing support is now
	complete.

	* mc-pgp5.el, mailcrypt.el, mc-gpg.el: Changed behavior of
	mc-pgp50-process-region to use more "Mailcryptish" messages.  In
	part, this is to facilitate key fetching and snarfing, using code
	contributed by Brian Warner.  We're getting close!

1998-09-22  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Changed "distclean" target to remove derived file
	"gpgwrap.pl".

	* mc-pgp5.el, gpgwrap.pl, gpgwrap.pl.in, mc-gpg.el, Makefile.in,
	configure, configure.in: Changed gpgwrap.pl to an "autoconf" file
	so that the path to perl is set at configuration time.  Also added
	minor fixes to PGP 5.0 encryption.

	* mc-gpg.el: Oops again.  Missed mc-gpg.el this time.

	* README.gpg, gpgwrap.pl: Oops--added in contributed files from
	Brian Warner containing the guts of GPG support.  The previous
	revision included only changes to existing files.  All better now!

	* mc-toplev.el, Makefile.in, mailcrypt.el, mc-setversion.el,
	INSTALL: Added complete implementation of GnuPG support.  Also
	fixed up mc-setversion so that version selection behaves more like
	the documentation claims.  Documentation includes discussion of
	the new GnuPG support.  Much thanks to Brian Warner, again!

	* mc-pgp5.el: Implemented functional Key Snarfing under PGP 5.0.
	Thanks to Brian Warner!

	* mc-remail.el: Modified remailer support to handle multiple
	newsgroups correctly.  I'm having real trouble posting with
	Mixmaster remailers, so this is pretty experimental.

1998-09-01  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-1, mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.info: Updated
	precompiled info files.

	* mc-pgp.el: Updated MIT public keyserver address for PGP 2.6.x
	key lookup.  Thanks to Bill Wohler.

	* mailcrypt.texi, mc-remail.el: Updated finger address for
	remailer list in variable documentation.  Changed regexp for
	parsing Levien remailer list to account for single quotes, which
	are sometimes used.

1998-08-29  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.info-2, mailcrypt.texi, mailcrypt.info-1,
	mailcrypt.info, mailcrypt.dvi, Makefile.in, configure,
	configure.in: Updated Mailcrypt documentation--still a long way to
	go.  Also fixed up the installation of info files, so the new
	documentation will install correctly.

	* configure.in, configure: Fixed a bug in the configure script
	which got confused when emacs (or Xemacs) are referred to by their
	full pathname.  Thanks to Sergio Antoy.

1998-08-28  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Moved definition of
	mc-pgp-always-sign into mailcrypt.el so that it applies to all
	encryption schemes at once.  Also fixed a bug which prevented
	deactivation of an incorrect passphrase when signing and
	encrypting in one step.

	* mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp5.el: Fixed a bug in the RFC-822
	regular expression for mail headers.  Also enhanced PGP keyid
	lookup to ignore revoked keys in both PGP 2 and PGP 5.  Thanks to
	Dean Bullock for spotting this bug.

1998-08-27  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mailcrypt.el: Modified mc-field-name-regexp to match on exactly
	those email headers which are RFC-822 compliant.

	* mailcrypt.el: Changed mc-field-name-regexp so that fields with
	":" in their bodies work correctly.  This permits addresses like
	"null:" and like "post: alt.test" when using mixmaster remailers.
	Note however that the latter should also be generated seamlessly
	by mailcrypt when posting in the usual way.

	* mc-toplev.el: Updated Gnus support to look in
	gnus-original-article-buffer rather than in gnus-article-buffer
	for PGP stuff.  Gnus has been changed to actually delete PGP stuff
	when using gnus-article-hide-pgp, and this patch permits
	verification of signatures even when hidden.  Thanks to Dave Love.

1998-08-26  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Changed mc-pgp50-always-sign back to
	mc-pgp-always-sign.  As a result, encrypting for remailers does
	not prompt repeatedly "Sign the message?"  As a side effect,
	"always sign" really means always; for every coding scheme.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Fixed a stupid typo introduced in the previous
	revision.

1998-08-25  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Enabled signing and encrypting in one step.  Thanks
	to Fabien Coelho.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Added public key insertion for PGP 5.0, and fixed
	the annoying lack of newlines at the and of PGP messages.  Thanks
	to Sergio Antoy.

	* mc-pgp5.el: Added Mailcrypt comment to signed messages in PGP
	5.0.

1998-08-23  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el, mc-setversion.el, mc-toplev.el, Makefile.in,
	mailcrypt.el, mc-pgp.el, mc-pgp2.el, INSTALL: Completed a major
	rewrite.  Basic elisp code is unchanged, and overall functionality
	is unchanged.  However, I restored the original mailcrypt files to
	their prior condition (almost), and implemented PGP 5 support
	through the "scheme" mechanism originally provided by Pat and Jin.
	Though there are pros and cons to both their approach and mine, I
	would rather stick with theirs.  Now GPG support can be added
	fairly simply!

1998-08-19  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL: Changed setup info for .emacs file to load
	"mc-setversion" rather than autoloading it.  After all, it's silly
	to "autoload" something and then immediately call it!  Thanks to
	Aaron Gross and David Maslen.

	* configure: Generated updated configure script.

	* configure.in, INSTALL: Tweaked the EMACSFLAGS for Xemacs to work
	for both Xemacs 19.x and 20.x.  Fixed up the INSTALL file to
	document these slight differences.

1998-08-18  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* configure.in, configure, Makefile.in: Added "--vanilla" flag for
	Xemacs compiling, and modified the "configure" script to abort if
	emacs or Xemacs are not found.  Also, changed the override to use
	the environment variable "EMACS" instead of the totally ridiculous
	"EMACS19".  Thanks to Amir J. Katz.

1998-07-29  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* FSF-timer.el, Makefile.in, configure, configure.in, timer.el:
	Moved "timer.el" to a file of another name, to prevent
	inadvertantly including it when the timer package is already
	installed.

	* timer.el: Used a different version of timer.el which doesn't
	BREAK mailcrypt for NON xemacs users.

1998-07-26  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed "make dist" to include timer.el.  Oops!

1998-07-24  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* ANNOUNCE, NEWS: Updated announcement and news files.

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old: Moved Jin and Pat's ChangeLog data
	into ChangeLog.old for the sake of history.  The Changelog file
	will be automatically generated from my sources from now on.

	* ONEWS, ChangeLog, NEWS: Updated news and changelog files for the
	anticipated flurry of development and bug fixes.

1998-07-23  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* NEWS, ANNOUNCE, INSTALL, LCD-entry, mailcrypt.el: *** empty log
	message ***

	* INSTALL, README: Updated documentation for Xemacs users, and
	deleted some (old, and apparently obsolete) pointers from the
	README file.

	* configure.in, timer.el, Makefile.in, configure: Added timer.el
	to the Mailcrypt distribution, so that Mailcrypt should work
	correctly for Xemacs users.  The configure script simply checks
	whether timer.el is in the user's load path, and includes timer.el
	in the list of files to compile and install if it isn't.

1998-07-22  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* mc-pgp5.el: Modified mc-pgp5-sign-parser to behave correctly
	when signing 8bit data.  In that case, the PGP delimiter reads
	"END PGP MESSAGE" rather than "END PGP SIGNATURE".  Thanks to Greg
	Steuck.

1998-07-21  Leonard R. Budney  <lbudney@pobox.com>

	* load-path.hack, Makefile.in: Made Makefile more conformant to
	GNU standards, and eliminated annoying warning about Emacs
	versions other than 19.*.  Thanks to Tony Silva.

	* mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info: Updated version number in elisp
	code.

	* pgpv.sh, pgpe.sh, pgps.sh, mc-setversion.el, mc-pgp5.el,
	mc-pgpk, mc-pgp.el, Makefile.in: Removed dependency on shell
	scripts and perl scripts.  Added completion to mc-setversion.
	Thanks to Brian Warner.

	* mc-pgp5.el, INSTALL: Corrected initialization instructions and
	fixed regular expression to permit handling of emails in Svenska.
	Thanks to Jonas Linde.

	* mailcrypt.dvi, mailcrypt.texi, mc-pgpk, mkinstalldirs, pgpe.sh,
	pgps.sh, pgpv.sh, texi2html.ext: Initial revision.

	* mailcrypt.dvi, mailcrypt.texi, mc-pgpk, mkinstalldirs, pgpe.sh,
	pgps.sh, pgpv.sh, texi2html.ext: New file.

	* ANNOUNCE, ChangeLog, INSTALL, LCD-entry, Makefile.in, NEWS,
	ONEWS, README, configure, configure.in, expect.el, install-sh,
	load-path.hack, mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info, mc-pgp.el,
	mc-pgp2.el, mc-pgp5.el, mc-remail.el, mc-setversion.el,
	mc-toplev.el: Initial revision.

	* ANNOUNCE, ChangeLog, INSTALL, LCD-entry, Makefile.in, NEWS,
	ONEWS, README, configure, configure.in, expect.el, install-sh,
	load-path.hack, mailcrypt.el, mailcrypt.info, mc-pgp.el,
	mc-pgp2.el, mc-pgp5.el, mc-remail.el, mc-setversion.el,
	mc-toplev.el: New file.
