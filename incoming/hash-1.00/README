This directory contains the current release of the GNU Emacs Lisp hash
library package.

It consists of the following files:

ChangeLog		History of changes to the package.

COPYING			The GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.

Makefile		UNIX Makefile.

NEWS			What's new with this release of the package.

README			This file.

TO-DO			Comments and musings about future versions of
			the package.			

detexinfo		Simple script for stripping TeXinfo markup
			prior to spelling checks et al.

hash.dvi		TeX DVI file from hash.texi.

hash.el			GNU Emacs Lisp hash library code.

hash.pdf		Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format version
			of the documentation, produced from hash.ps.

hash.ps			PostScript version of the documentation, produced 
			from hash.dvi.

hash.sok		Customized spelling exception dictionary for hash.texi.

hash.texi		Documentation for the hash library, intended
			to be dropped into the next edition of the GNU
			Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, with little more
			than modification of the initial @node line,
			and removal of the initial @setfilename line,
			and the final @bye line.

profile.awk		Simple awk program for computing a relative
			performance table from run-time profiles; used
			at the end of hash.texi.

profile-support.el	Additional profile support code for use in
			test-primes.el.	  This file is independent of
			the test package, and may be freely duplicated
			in other Emacs library test packages.  It
			should eventually be absorbed into
			emacs/20.x.y/lisp/emacs-lisp/profile.el.

run-tests.el		Simple driver file to test the hash and primes
			libraries; in Emacs, just do M-x
			load-file<RET>run-tests.el to load and run the
			tests.

test-hash.el		Test program for running the torture test
			suite that validates the correct operation of
			the hash library.  In Emacs,  do M-x
			load-file<RET>test-hash.el, then do
			M-x test-hash or M-x test-hash-with-profile.

To use the hash library, you also require the primes library,
available at the same location where you got this package.  Both
should shortly be part of standard Emacs distributions.

NB: at other sites, you will probably need to override the setting of
DVIPS when you run make, if you want to generate a new PostScript file
of the documentation.  At the author's site, a special version is used
to ensure that PostScript Type1 outline, rather than bitmap, fonts are
used, because they significantly improve the display quality of the
derived PDF file.

The doubled-word utility, dw, referred to in the Makefile is available
at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/index.html#dw

or equivalently

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/dw.*

in a variety of distribution formats.

The enhanced tgrind program, tgrind, referred to in the Makefile is
available at

	http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/index.html#tgrind-3.00

or equivalently,

	ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/misc/tgrind-3.00.*

in a variety of distribution formats.

The hash library has been successfully tested on these systems:

	DEC Alpha		OSF/1 3.2
	HP 9000/735		HP-UX 10.01
	IBM PowerPC		AIX 4.2
	Intel Pentium II MMX	GNU/Linux 2.0.35
	Intel Pentium II MMX	Microsoft Windows 98
	Intel Pentium II MMX	AT&T UWIN32 on top of Microsoft Windows 98
	NeXT Turbostation	Mach 3.3
	SGI Indigo/2		IRIX 5.3
	SGI O2 R10000-SC	IRIX 6.3
	SGI Origin 200		IRIX 6.4
	Sun SPARC		Solaris 2.6
	Sun SPARC		SunOS 4.1.3

with emacs-19.34, emacs-20.2.96, and emacs-20.3.6, where available.

Because it requires floating-point support, which was implemented
first in emacs-19.xx, it will not run with emacs-18.xx, which, sadly,
is the latest version available on the Apple Macintosh OS.
