ps-print.tar.gz has the following files:

   lisp/ps-print/ps-bdf.el	BDF font file handler
   lisp/ps-print/ps-mule.el	multi-byte character facility
   lisp/ps-print/ps-print.el	main file
   lisp/ps-print/ps-print.new	News

   etc/ps-print/ps-prin0.ps	prologue file 0
   etc/ps-print/ps-prin1.ps	prologue file 1
   etc/ps-print/ps-prin2.ps	prologue file 2
   etc/ps-print/ps-prin3.ps	prologue file 3

On GNU Emacs, the prologue files (ps-prin*.ps) should be installed in
directory given by `data-directory' variable which contains a string
like "/usr/share/emacs/20.3/etc/".

On XEmacs, the prologue files (ps-prin*.ps) should be installed in
directory given by `(locate-data-directory "ps-print")'.

If you wish to install prologue files in another directory, you should
customize `ps-postscript-code-directory' to contain the directory.

One way to set `ps-postscript-code-directory' is to insert in your
~/.emacs:

   (setq ps-postscript-code-directory "/directory/of/prologue/files/")

Or type:

   M-x set-variable RET ps-postscript-code-directory RET
   "/directory/of/prologue/files/" RET

Or type:

   M-x ps-print-customize RET
   and customize `ps-postscript-code-directory'.

Note that it's important the last "/".


Happy hacking
