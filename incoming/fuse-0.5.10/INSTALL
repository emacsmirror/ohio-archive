There are few things that have to be configured before compiling and
installing FUSE.  Before starting, decide on these four things:

1.  Will you be using Emacs or XEmacs?
2.  Where will you be installing FUSE?  All of the lisp scripts and
    the various ancillary files (pixmaps, plotting scripts, documents,
    etc.) will be installed to this directory.
3.  What is the location of perl on your computer.  You can find this
    out by typing `which perl' if you use tcsh or `type perl' if you
    use bash.
4.  Do you want the configuration script to add some lines to your
    .emacs so that you can use FUSE?  If you have done so before, you
    can answer no to that question.

To configure, compile, and install, do the following:

 > sh configure
 > make
 > make install

That's all!

Installation as a normal user:
  The answer to the second question -- the installation location --
  should be the directory you keep your personal Emacs lisp files.

Installation as root:
  The answer to the second question -- the installation location --
  should be the site-lisp directory or any other system directory in
  the Emacs load-path.  The answer to the fourth question, the one
  about editing .emacs, should be no.  The installation script
  currently doesn't know how to edit the site-start file.  You will
  have to do so by hand.  (See the next paragraph.)


If you do not have the configuration script append lines to your
.emacs file, be sure to add lines like these by hand so that you FUSE
will be automatically used for your input files.  Replace
"~/lisp/fuse" in the first line with whatever the installation
directory is.

       (setq load-path (append (list "~/lisp/fuse" ) load-path))
       (setq auto-mode-alist
             (append (list (cons "\\.inp$" 'input-mode))
                     auto-mode-alist))
       (autoload 'fuse-mode  "fuse"  "FUSE" t)
       (autoload 'input-mode "input" "Input major mode" t)
       (add-hook 'dired-load-hook '(lambda () (load-library "fuse-dired")))


Additional treats:
    --	In Atoms mode, the calc package is used to perform expansion
	of math expressions.  Get it from
		ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/calc-2.02f.tar.gz
    --	Imenu support for Feffit and Autobk is built into those
	modes.  This lets you use Imenu as well as Speedbar with
	input files.  Get Speedbar from
		ftp://ftp.ultranet.com/pub/zappo/
	Put this in your .emacs file to turn on input file support in
	Speedbar:
		(add-hook 'speedbar-mode-hook
	 	  '(lambda ()
		     (speedbar-add-supported-extension ".inp")))
	Imenu is a standard part of Emacs and can be compiled well
	under XEmacs so that Speedbar can use it.

Here are the old installation instructions.  I have left them here in
case the new configuration script and install makefile target do not
work properly.  What follows is how to do by hand what the new
utilities try to do automatically.

The installation procedures are still kind of `hands on', but they are
not that bad.  Do this:

1.  Unpack the archive in whatever directory you use to store your
    personal emacs lisp stuff.  If you do not have one,
		mkdir ~/lisp/
    or something like that, then unpack the archive in that
    directory. 

2.  cd to ~/lisp/fuse-0.5.5/ (or whatever the version number is)

3.  If you are using GNU Emacs, copy Makefile.emacs to Makefile.  If
    you are using XEmacs, copy Makefile.xemacs to Makefile.

4.  Look at the file input.el.  Near the beginning is the definition
    of the variable `fuse-base-directory'.  It is defined as
	(expand-file-name "~/xlisp/fuse/")
    Change "~/xlisp/fuse/" to "~/lisp/fuse-0.5.5/" or whatever
    directory you are using.  This is very important.  FUSE uses the
    value of this variable to find documentation, scripts needed to
    plot data, and the toolbars for the XEmacs frame.  See #8 below
    some hints about how to handle this in a more general fashion.

5.  make  (this will byte compile all of the lisp scripts and fix up
    the stuff in the scripts directory) 

6.  put these lines in your .emacs file:

       (setq load-path (append (list "~/lisp/fuse-0.5.5" ) load-path))
       (setq auto-mode-alist
             (append (list (cons "\\.inp$" 'input-mode))
                     auto-mode-alist))
       (autoload 'fuse-mode  "fuse"  "FUSE" t)
       (autoload 'input-mode "input" "Input major mode" t)
       (add-hook 'dired-load-hook '(lambda () (load-library "fuse-dired")))

    The first line tells emacs where to find FUSE.  It should point to
    the true location where you installed FUSE.

    The next three lines tell emacs to use FUSE for files ending in
    `.inp' and how to find the appropriate files.

    The last line enables batch processing of input files in a dired
    buffer.  See the chapter on "running programs" in the FUSE
    document for details about this.

7.  You can put any further customizations in your .emacs file or in a
    file called .fuse.  You can also use the customization package
    with Emacs 20 or XEmacs 20.  See the section on customization in
    the document.

8.  It is convenient to have a way to install FUSE such that steps 4
    and 6 don't have to be repeated each time a new version is
    installed.  Here is the best thing I have come up with.  In your
    lisp directory make a symbolic link to the directory containing
    the FUSE distribution:
	ln -s fuse-0.5.5 fuse
    Then change the load-path line from step 6 to   
        (setq load-path (append (list "~/lisp/fuse" ) load-path))
    Finally, you need to handle the value of the `fuse-base-directory'
    variable.  If you do one of the following, it will not matter what
    the value is in future versions of input.el.  Do one of the
    following, replacing "~/xlisp/fuse/" with the appropriate value:  
	-- Put this line in your .emacs file:
	     (add-hook 'input-mode-hook '(lambda ()
		(setq fuse-base-directory
		   (expand-file-name "~/xlisp/fuse/"))))
	-- Put this line in your .fuse file:
	     (setq fuse-base-directory
		(expand-file-name "~/xlisp/fuse/"))
	-- Use the customization package in Emacs 20 to set
	   `input-base-directory'.  Do M-x customize-group and answer
	   with "fuse".  Then find `fuse-base-directory' and change
	   its value appropriately.

    After this, all you will have to do when you install a future
    version of FUSE is change the symbolic link.

9.  Additional treats:
    --	In Atoms mode, the calc package is used to perform expansion
	of math expressions.  Get it from
		ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/calc-2.02f.tar.gz
    --	Imenu support for Feffit and Autobk is built into those
	modes.  This lets you use Imenu as well as Speedbar with
	input files.  Get Speedbar from
		ftp://ftp.ultranet.com/pub/zappo/
	Put this in your .emacs file to turn on input file support in
	Speedbar:
		(add-hook 'speedbar-mode-hook
	 	  '(lambda ()
		     (speedbar-add-supported-extension ".inp")))
	Imenu is a standard part of Emacs and can be partially
	compiled under XEmacs.
