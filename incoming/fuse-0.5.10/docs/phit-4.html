<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Rules for Using Functions</A></H2>

<P>Arguments to functions must be enclosed by parentheses.  For instance
<CODE>cos(pi)</CODE> evaluates to <CODE>1</CODE>. </P>
<P>Arguments to trigonometric functions must be in radians.  Use set
values to convert between degrees and radian, if desired.  Here is an
example of varying an angle in degrees and calculating the function
in radians: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        guess           alphad  0
        set             alpha   alphad * pi / 180
        function        1       tan(alpha)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 </P>
<P>Some of these function have singular values. Be <B>very careful</B>
when using singular functions in a fit.  There is no problem using
these functions in your fitting model so long as the singular point is
not included in your fit.  The residual at this point will be so much
larger than any other in the fit, that the minimization will be
ill-posed.  If the singular point is excluded either by judicious
choice of input grid or by excluding data from the fit by using the
<CODE>x1 - x10</CODE> keywords, then the fit should be well behaved. </P>
<P>Functions with singular or undefined values for certain values of the
argument are error checked before evaluating to avoid run-time errors.
For example, <CODE>ln(-1)</CODE> will return 0, <CODE>atan(0)</CODE> will
return 10&circ;40, and so on.  The program will therefore not crash if a
function is poorly used in a fitting model.  The quality of the fit,
however, should be quite poor. </P>
<P>Int and nint might be troublesome functions in the fit, since changes
in the argument can produce absolutely no change in the evaluation of
the function.  They are included for completeness -- use them with
caution.  Note that <CODE>int(3.7) = 3</CODE> and <CODE>nint(3.7) = 4</CODE>.  
Also, <CODE>int(2)</CODE> might return 1 if your computer
represents the floating point value of 2 as, for instance, 1.99999837,
which is a valid representation. </P>
<P>The commas in the argument lists to the special functions of multiple
arguments are necessary.  In my experience, a reasonably good first
guess for the peak positions of the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions
is necessary for a well-posed fitting problem. </P>
<P>The temperatures in the Einstein function are in Kelvin and the
reduced mass is in atomic units.  Here is a good way to specify the
reduced mass:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        set     r_cu    63.546
        set     r_ba    137.33
        set     rmass   1 / ( 1/r_cu + 1/r_ba )
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 </P>
<P>At present, <CODE>pi</CODE> is the only recognized special constant. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 The Peak Function.</A></H2>

<P>This is a function of ten arguments (!) that returns the position of a
diffraction peak in two-theta and in degrees.  The arguments are the
x-ray wavelength, the Miller indices, the cell axis lengths, and the
cell angles.  The wavelength and axis lengths must be in consistent
units.  That is, all four must be in angstroms or in nanometers or
whatever.  The function will behave identically for different units,
so long as they are consistent.  The cell angles are in degrees.
Fractions of degrees should be specified as decimals rather than
minutes and seconds of arc.  All ten arguments must be specified.  The
value for the angle that is returned is the angle of the two-theta
circle.   </P>
<P>This function only is used for peak position, which is dependent only
on the geometry of the unit cell of a crystal.  It is derived from
Bragg's law and uses the formulas for interplanar spacing and cell
volume in a triclinic cell.  This should be well described in any
introductory crystallography text book.  <SF>Phit</SF> presently has
no specific capability for computing crystallographic amplitude and
width.  A Gaussian or a Lorentzian (or some linear combination of the
two) centered at the position found by the peak function is a
reasonable approximation of the shape of a diffraction peak. </P>
