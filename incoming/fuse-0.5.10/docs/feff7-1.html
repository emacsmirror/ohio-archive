<P>FEFF7 calculates wave phase shifts, effective scattering amplitudes 
and single and multiple scattering curved XAFS and XANES spectra, 
including polarization dependence, for clusters of atoms (Z &lt; 96). </P>
<P>The calculation is automated and done sequentially in four steps: </P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> The scattering potentials,  phase shifts, dipole matrix
elements and absolute energies are calculated 
(module <B>POTPH</B>, potentials and phases)</LI>
<LI> The scattering paths for the cluster are enumerated.
(module <B>PATHS</B>)</LI>
<LI> The effective scattering amplitudes and other XAFS
parameters are calculated for each scattering path.
(module <B>GENFMT</B>, general-path F-matrix calculation)</LI>
<LI> The XAFS parameters from one or more paths are combined to
calculate a total XAFS spectrum.  (module <B>FF2CHI</B>, scattering
amplitude to chi, feff is the effective curved wave 
scattering amplitude)</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>For details on use of the code, examples and suggestions on calculation
strategies, see sections 2, 3 and 4.  For details about the algorithms
used see the discussion on the appropriate module in section 2 and,
for more detail, the published references in Appendix C. </P>

<P>FEFF is written in ANSI FORTRAN 77, with the non-standard extension of
double precision complex (complex*16) variables. It requires about
3 megabytes of available memory to run.  See Appendix B for complete
installation instructions. </P>

<P>FEFF7 is copyright protected software and users must obtain a license
from the University of Washington Office of Technology Transfer for its

<P>Please cite FEFF if the code or its results are used in published work.

<P>Part of the original FEFF3 code was developed in collaboration with J.
Mustre de Leon and is still part of FEFF5, FEFF6 and FEFF7. Input/output
of FEFF7 was substantially improved by S. I. Zabinsky. The authors
thank the users of the experimental versions of these codes and especially
M. Newville and B. Ravel for comments and suggestions.  </P>
