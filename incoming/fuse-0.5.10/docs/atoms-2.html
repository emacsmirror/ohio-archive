<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 General Format</A></H2>


<P>Take a peek at Appendix B.  Included there are many examples of input
files for <SF>atoms</SF>.  Each one specifies lattice parameters, a
space group, positions of atoms within the unit cell, and a few other
pieces of information. The purpose of this chapter is teach you how to
construct input files, thus to communicate with <SF>atoms</SF>. </P>
<P><CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> uses keywords to describe the inputs. With only
a few exceptions, the keywords are allowed to occur in any order in
the file, and usually have transparent meanings.  This structure
allows the input file to be easily read and modified.  All keywords
use the syntax: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        keyword delimiter value(s) delimiter ...
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The delimiter can be:  </P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>one or more white spaces (blanks and/or TABs)</LI>
<LI>one equal sign and any number of white spaces</LI>
<LI>one comma and any number of white spaces   </LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Most keywords take only one value. Many keywords can be put on one
line (though some keywords require their own line).  Internal comments
can be written anywhere in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>, which help remind
you what the keywords mean, or how you chose the input
values. Keywords can be in upper, lower, or mixed case. <SF>atoms</SF>
is not sensitive to the case of keywords or their values. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 List of Keywords</A></H2>


<P>Here is a summary of keywords and their meanings.  The following
sections give more detailed explanations for each keyword.  Where
appropriate, default values are given in brackets.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Explanations of Keywords</A></H2>


<P>
<DL>

<DT><B> * or % or ! </B><DD><P>Everything after one of these characters on a line in the input file
will be ignored by <SF>atoms</SF>.</P>

<DT><B> Title </B><DD><P>Indicates a user-chosen title line which will be written to
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE>. 
9 title lines of 72 characters each can be used.  Everything on a line
after the keyword title will be included in the title.  If keywords
are on the line following title, they will be read as part of the
title, not as separate keywords.  The word <CODE>comment</CODE> is synonymous with
<CODE>title</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B> Space </B><DD><P>This keyword is followed by the Hermann-Maguin or Schoenflies
designation for the space group.  Complete lists of these designations
are are found in Appendix A.  Because the Hermann-Maguin designation,
as adapted for the keyboard, includes spaces, this keyword is handled
specially by <SF>atoms</SF>. <CODE>space</CODE> should be on its own line or at
the end of a line.</P>

<DT><B> A </B><DD><P>This specifies the first lattice constant.  A must always be
specified.  In a cubic or rhombohedral space groups, where only one
lattice parameter is needed, A is the one to specify.</P>

<DT><B> B </B><DD><P>This specifies the second lattice constant.  It is set equal to A
unless specified.</P>

<DT><B> C </B><DD><P>This specifies the third lattice constant.  It is set equal to A
unless specified.  In tetragonal, or hexagonal space groups, this is
the second lattice constant that must be specified.</P>

<DT><B> Alpha </B><DD><P>This specifies the angle between B and C.  Specify the angle in
degrees.  This is the angle that must be specified for rhombohedral
space groups.  The default value is 90 deg.</P>

<DT><B> Beta </B><DD><P>This specifies the angle between C and A.  Specify the angle in
degrees.  The default value is 90 deg.  This is the angle that must be
specified for monoclinic space groups.</P>

<DT><B> Gamma </B><DD><P>This specifies the angle between A and B.  Specify the angle in
degrees.  The default value is 90 deg for orthogonal groups and 120
deg for hexagonal and trigonal groups.</P>

<DT><B> Core </B><DD><P>This specifies the absorbing atom.  The value of this keyword must be
a site tag.  This atom will be placed at the center of the cluster and
will be used as the central atom in the McMaster and fluorescent
correction calculations.  The central atom must be specified by this
keyword.  This is a change from early versions of <SF>atoms</SF>. This
keyword has no default.  A central atom must be specified.  The
keyword <CODE>central</CODE> is synonymous with <CODE>core</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B> Rmax </B><DD><P>This specifies the maximum radial distance in the cluster of
calculated atomic coordinates.</P>

<DT><B> Index </B><DD><P>This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  Along
with the coordinates, the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> contains the
symbol of each atom.  With the index feature turned off, only the two
letter symbol of each atom is printed.  With it turned on, atoms of
the same type will be numbered sequentially according to distance.  To
enable this feature, the syntax is 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        index  true
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
   
An example: in pure copper, the 12 nearest neighbors will be labeled
Cu01, the 6 next neighbors will be labeled Cu02, and so on.  Without
indexing, all the atoms will be labeled Cu.</P>

<DT><B> Shift </B><DD><P>Moves all atoms in the atom list by the specified amount. This keyword
takes three real numbers as its values.  The syntax is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        shift  xvalue  yvalue  zvalue
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The value of the shift vector is simply added to all fractional atomic
coordinates in the atom list.  Read the section on Multiple Origins in
section 3.6 for a discussion of the usefulness of this keyword.</P>

<DT><B> Out </B><DD><P>This specifies an output file name other than <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.  It can
be up to 72 characters, so can include a directory path as well as the
file name.  If <CODE>out = list</CODE> is specified then a file called
<CODE>atoms.lis</CODE> will be written instead of <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.
<CODE>atoms.lis</CODE> will contain the title lines and the coordinate list
but none of headers or <SF>feff</SF> keywords.  This option is useful for
applications other than <SF>feff</SF> that require a list of atomic
coordinates.</P>

<DT><B> Edge </B><DD><P>This specifies the absorption edge of the central atom.  If edge is
not specified, the default value is determined from the Z of the
central atom.  For central atoms with Z&lt;=57, the K edge is chosen.
For heavier atoms, the L3 edge is chosen.  K, L1, L2, and L3 are the
only values for edge recognized by <SF>atoms</SF>.</P>

<DT><B> Nitrogen </B><DD><P>This number specifies the percentage by pressure of nitrogen gas
in the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment.  Specifying
either this keyword or the argon or krypton keywords tells
<SF>atoms</SF> to estimate the corrections to the data due to the
energy response of the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the
sample.  These calculations are described in detail in chapter 4.
This keyword takes a real number between 0 and 1 as its value. The
default is that the fluorescence calculations are turned off.</P>

<DT><B> Argon </B><DD><P>This number specifies the percentage by pressure of argon gas in
the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment.  Specifying either
this keyword or the nitrogen or krypton keywords tells <SF>atoms</SF>
to estimate the corrections to the data due to the energy response of
the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the sample.  These
calculations are described in detail in chapter 4.  This keyword takes
a real number between 0 and 1 as its value. The default is that the
fluorescence calculations are turned off.</P>

<DT><B> Krypton </B><DD><P>This number specifies the percentage by pressure of krypton gas
in the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment.  Specifying
either this keyword or the nitrogen or argon keywords tells
<SF>atoms</SF> to estimate the corrections to the data due to the
energy response of the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the
sample.  These calculations are described in detail in chapter 4.
This keyword takes a real number between 0 and 1 as its value. The
default is that the fluorescence calculations are turned off.</P>

<DT><B> Geom </B><DD><P>This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  If
true, <SF>atoms</SF> will write a file called <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> for use in the
path finder module of <SF>feff</SF>.  If <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> is written, the
<CODE>NOGEOM</CODE> card will be written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B> Unit </B><DD><P>This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  If true,
<SF>atoms</SF> will write a file called <CODE>unit.dat</CODE> contining the atomic
coordinates of all atoms in the unit cell as well as all atoms on the
walls, edges, and corners of the unit cell.</P>

<DT><B> P1 </B><DD><P>This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  If true,
<SF>atoms</SF> will write a file called <CODE>p1.inp</CODE>.  This file is a valid
input file for <SF>atoms</SF>.  It contains the entire contents of the
unit cell in the atoms list and has the space keyword set to <CODE>p 1</CODE>,
the monoclinic space group of no internal symmetries.  All axes and
angles are explicitly specified in <CODE>p1.inp</CODE>, as are <CODE>core</CODE>,
<CODE>edge</CODE>, <CODE>rmax</CODE>, and all of the title lines.</P>

<DT><B> Feff </B><DD><P>This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  By
default it is true and will write out <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.  If it is false,
<SF>atoms</SF> will not calculate the cluster of atoms, thus will not
write out either <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> or <CODE>geom.dat</CODE>.</P>

<DT><B> Dopant </B><DD><P>This keyword specifies the type and percent substitution of a dopant
material.  The syntax is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        dopant  dp  tag  percentage
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Where <CODE>dp</CODE> is the atomic symbol of the doping atom, <CODE>tag</CODE> is
the site tag of the site where the dopant resides, and the percentage
is a real number between 0 and 1 specifying the amount of
substitution.  If <CODE>tag</CODE> is an atomic symbol rather than a site tag,
then all sites containing that atomic species will affected.</P>

<DT><B> Atom </B><DD><P>This must be the last keyword in the input file.  If it is not the
program will almost certainly stop running.  This keyword tells the
program to go to the next line and begin reading in the unique atom
coordinates.  The atom list is a five column, structured list.  Column
one is the two letter atomic symbol (<B>not</B> the Z number).  Columns
two through four contain the x, y, and z coordinates of each atom.
These numbers are entered as fractions of the a, b, and c axes
respectively.  The fifth column contains the site tag. See section 2.4
for an explanation of the site tags.  The keywords atom and basis are
incompatible.  If both are specified in an input file, the program
will stop running.</P>

<DT><B> Basis </B><DD><P>This must be the last keyword in the input file.  If it is not the
program will almost certainly stop running.  This keyword tells the
program to go to the next line and begin reading in the basis atom
coordinates.  The basis list is a five column, structured list.
Column one is the two letter atomic symbol (<B>not</B> the Z number).
Columns two through four contain the x, y, and z coordinates of each
atom.  These numbers are entered as fractions of the a, b, and c axes
respectively.  The fifth column contains the site tag. See section 2.4
for an explanation of the site tags.  A basis may be constructed
around an empty site.  Specify that site with the word <CODE>null</CODE>
rather than an atomic symbol.  The keywords atom and basis are
incompatible.  If both are specified in an input file, the program
will stop running.</P>

<H2><A NAME="core"></A> <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Specifying Site Tags and the Central Atom</A></H2>


<P>The central atom of the cluster written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> must
be explicitly specified with the keyword core.  To avoid ambiguity in
a situation involving inequivalent crystallographic sites containing
the same atomic species, the value of this keyword must be a site tag.
The site tags are the user supplied character strings which appear in
the fifth column of the atom or basis list. </P>
<P><B>Users of Atoms 2.41 and prior versions:</B> This is the most
important difference between <SF>atoms 2.42</SF> and versions numbered
2.41 and lower.  Previously the fifth column of the atom or basis list
was used to specify the central atom.  The addition of site tags used
to label the different sites requires specification of the central
atom by keyword. </P>
<P>The fifth column of the atom list contains the site tag.  The user may
label the sites in any way desired and these labels may be up to 10
characters long.  The sites must be labeled uniquely or else
<SF>atoms</SF> will become confused if one of the sites labeled
redundantly is chosen as the core atom.  If a tag is not specified for
a site then the default tag will be used.  The default for a site tags
is to label that site with the atomic symbol of the occupying atom.
Remember that <SF>atoms</SF> is insensitive to case, thus the tag
<CODE>THISATOM</CODE> is the same as <CODE>thisatom</CODE> and <CODE>ThisAtom</CODE>. </P>
<P>Here is an example.  Note that the the value of core is a tag, not an
element symbol. </P>

</P>
<P>This is the <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> for superconducting Y Ba2 Cu3 O7.  Notice
that the copper and oxygen sites are tagged with unique labels.  The
central atom is specified with one of these labels -- the <CODE>Cu1</CODE>
site will be at the center of the cluster written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.
The yttrium and barium sites are tagged with the atomic symbol by
default.  Since each of these species occupies only one site, there is
no ambiguity in using the atomic symbol as the tag.</P>
<P>In <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> each atom will be identified by its tag, not by its
atomic symbol.  Assignment of unique potentials, however, is based on
atomic species.  If you wish to assign unique potentials based on
crystallographic considerations, you will need to edit <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Basis List v. Atom List</A></H2>


<P><SF>atoms</SF> has the ability to recognize basis vectors.  For some
lattice types this is a somewhat nicer way of describing the
structure.  In introductory solid state physics texts, the diamond
structure is often described as face centered cubic with a two atom
basis.  For example, silicon might be specified as a diamond structure
crystal with a unique atom at position (1/8, 1/8, 1/8).  It might also
be specified as an FCC structure with a basis of (0,0,0) and (1/4,
1/4, 1/4).</P>
<P><SF>atoms</SF> handles a basis list slightly differently from an atom
list.  When given an atom list, the code translates each point in the
list by the symmetry operations specified in the space group name.
When given a basis list, the code only performs these symmetry
operations on one of the points listed.  It then constructs the basis
at each of the points so generated.  The keyword core may select any
atom in the basis as the central atom of the cluster. </P>
<P>The best use of this feature would be to generate an atom list for a
structure that is described by a periodic repetition of some large,
complex local structure.  Clathrates are an excellent example of this. </P>
<P>One very important rule must be followed when using a basis list.  The
first atom in the list must correctly represent the desired
translation symmetry.  In the case of silicon, the basis must be
translated like the point (0,0,0) in space group <CODE>F m 3 m</CODE> (the
space group of FCC crystals) to yield the diamond structure. Thus the
first atom in the basis list for silicon <B>must</B> be at (0,0,0) or
else the basis will not be expanded correctly.</P>
<P>A basis can be constructed around an empty site, by specifying the
coordinates of the empty site as the first entry in the basis list and
entering the word <CODE>null</CODE> instead of an atomic symbol.  The null site
will not appear in the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.  The keyword core
may not take <CODE>null</CODE> as a value.</P>
<P>To finish the example of silicon, here are two input files that give
the same output: </P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Dopants</A></H2>



<P><SF>atoms</SF> handles dopants in the simplest possible fashion.  It
assumes all dopants are substitutional and that there are no
correlations between cells regarding which lattice sites are occupied
by doping atoms.  Furthermore, <SF>atoms</SF> makes no assumptions about
which physical sites are occupied by dopants.  Thus the atom list
written to <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> is the list for the undoped structure.
<SF>atoms</SF> uses information about the dopants in the following ways:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>For calculating the density, the absorption, and the
experimental corrections.</LI>
<LI>A dopant may be the central atom in the atom list, thus the
calculations mentioned above will be performed at the absorption edge
of the dopant. </LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The syntax is: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
            dopant   dp   tag   percentage
 
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

where <CODE>dp</CODE> and <CODE>tag</CODE> are character strings and percentage is a
number between 0 and 1.  The value of <CODE>dp</CODE> is the atomic symbol of
the dopant.  The value of <CODE>tag</CODE> is the site tag of the site where
the dopant resides.  If the value of <CODE>tag</CODE> is an atomic symbol then
all sites containing that atomic species will be doped.</P>
<P><SF>atoms</SF> allows up to 3 dopants per site and no more than 9 in
the entire crystal.  If this is insufficient, then you have a mess on
your hands.  You also have my sympathy -- contact me and I will help
you alter the code to accommodate your horrid problem. </P>
<P>The atomic species specified for a site by the dopant keyword need not
be the minority component.  This might be useful for uniquely
specifying the core atom.   Vacancies may be introduced by doping
sites with <CODE>null</CODE>.</P>
<P>Analyzing a doped material in fine structure spectroscopies is
complicated.  The simple scheme that I describe in this section is
useful for several of the calculations in the code, but is clearly
insufficient for the task of resolving the local structure of a doped
material.  That <SF>atoms</SF> writes the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> using
the undoped structure is indicative of this.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Geom.dat</A></H2>



<P>The path finder in <SF>feff</SF> has an option to use crystal symmetries
in order to speed the determination and computation of all paths.
This is done by providing a file called <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> containing
special flags specifying the relevant symmetries.  Setting <CODE>geom =
true</CODE> in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> will tell <SF>atoms</SF> to write a <CODE>geom.dat</CODE>
file and to place the card <CODE>NOGEOM</CODE> in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE>.  This leads
to a large reduction of computation time only in crystals of high
symmetry.  In an fcc structure, the reduction in time can be as high
as a factor of about 50.  In a structure of lower symmetry, the
savings will rarely be more than a factor of about 4.  Use of the
geom.dat generated by <SF>atoms</SF> will not effect the computation time
of the potentials and phase shifts calculation of the first module of
<SF>feff</SF>, nor will it effect the computation time of the individual
paths in the third module.  The <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> file has the same atom
list as the <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> file.</P>
<P>To use the <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> file, it must be located in the directory in
which <SF>feff</SF> is run.  Since the <CODE>NOGEOM</CODE> card is in
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE>, <SF>feff</SF> will know to access at the appropriate time
the geom.dat file written by <SF>atoms</SF>.  The <CODE>geom.dat</CODE> file and
the atom list in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> should both remain unmodified, or else
<SF>feff</SF> might get confused.  The <SF>feff</SF> card <CODE>RMAX</CODE> can be
changed to limit the extent of the <SF>feff</SF> calculation without
needing to change geom.dat.  See the <SF>feff</SF> document for more
details about this.</P>
