<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Input file and FEFF commands</A></H2>



<P>The main program FEFF reads one file created directly by the user, the
file feff.inp.  This section describes feff.inp and the commands that
tell FEFF what to do.  It may be helpful to look at one or more of the
sample input files in Appendix D while reading this section.  An auxiliary
program ATOMS can generate the feff.inp file.  See the ATOMS card and the
document for ATOMS for additional details.  The input file for FEFF7 is
identical to FEFF5, except that additional options have been added to
permit XANES calculations, add polarization dependence and test new self
energy model.  </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 File format</A></H2>

<P>feff.inp is a free format line oriented file. Blank lines and lines
beginning with an asterisk (comment lines) are ignored wherever the
occur.  End of line comments are also ignored.  Each type of input read
by the program must contain a card with a &quot;keyword&quot; in 
CAPITAL LETTERS,
and in some cases, followed by data cards.  The sequence of keyword
cards is arbitrary. If any card is omitted, default values are used; an
exception is the POTENTIALS card, which is required. Numeric values are
listed in free format, separated by blanks. Tab characters are not
allowed (due to portability constraints) and may cause confusing error
messages.  Characters appearing after the expected data on a given line
are ignored by feff and can be used as end-of-line comments.  All
distances are in Angstroms and energies in eV. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Complete list of feff.inp keywords</A></H2>

<P>The list of feff.inp options fall into four categories, standard
options frequently and easily used, useful options that are often used,
special options that are seldom necessary or helpful, and obscure

<H3><B>POTENTIALS</B></H3>

<P>    </P>
<P>The data following the POTENTIALS card assigns a unique potential index
to each distinguishable atom. The potential index ipot is the index of
the potential to be used for the phase shift calculation. </P>
<P>The keyword POTENTIALS begins a unique potential list.  Each following
line (until the next keyword card) is a unique potential index, the
atomic number and optional tag (max 6 characters) for that unique
potential. The absorbing atom must be unique potential 0.  These unique
potential indices are simply labels, so the order is not important,
except that the absorbing atom is ipot 0, and you may not have missing
indices (ie, if you use ipot 3, you must also have defined unique
potentials 1 and 2). </P>
<P>To save time the code calculates the overlapped atom potential for each
unique potential only once, using as a sample geometry the first atom
in the atom list with a given unique potential index. Thus it is essential
that the neighborhood of that sample atom be representative.  Failure
to do so may cause the code to perform poorly (See Appendix G). </P>
<P>Because the phase shift calculation is the most time-consuming part of
FEFF, it may be useful to assume that the potential for a given shell
of atoms is the same as that of a previously calculated shell. For
example, in Cu it is a good approximation to determine potentials only
for the central atom and the  first shell and to use the first shell
potential (ipot=1) for all higher shells.  Such approximations should
be checked in each case.

<P>The real energy shift will shift E0 in the final chi and the imaginary
energy shift adds broadening to the result. The energy shift is useful
to correct for the error in FEFF's fermi level, which is typically
too high by about 3 eV, and the the broadening is typically used to
correct for instrument broadening, or as a correction to the mean free
path calculated by FEFF. This affects only the module FF2CHI, which
combines the results in all of the feff.dat files. It is useful because
you can simply make these energy corrections and see the results without
redoing the entire XAFS parameter calculation.  Both energies are in eV.

<H3><B>CRITERIA</B></H3>

<P> critcw critpw</P>
<P>Since the number of multiple scattering paths gets large very quickly,
it is necessary to eliminate as many paths as possible.  Fortunately,
we have found that most multiple scattering paths have small amplitudes
and can be neglected.  Various cutoff "criteria" are used in FEFF7 to
limit the number of paths to consider.  These criteria are based on the
importance of the path, defined as the integral over the full energy
range of |chi(k)|*dk. </P>
<P>critcw is the result of the full curved wave calculation.  A
calculation of critcw requires a complete spherical wave calculation,
which takes about 10 seconds on a SUN4.  The default value of critcw is
4%, meaning that any  path with mean amplitude exceeding 4% of largest
path will be used in calculation of chi. The criterion critcw is used
by GENFMT; since the XAFS parameter calculation is already done, the
savings is not in computer time, but in disk space and ease of
analysis.  The values of critcw for each path are written in the file
list.dat written by module GENFMT. </P>
<P>critpw is a plane-wave approximation to chi.  This is extremely fast to
calculate, and is used in the pathfinder.  The default value of critpw
is 2.5, meaning that any path with mean amplitude 2.5% of largest path,
including degeneracy factors,  (in plane wave approximation) will be
kept. Any path that does not meet this criterion will not be written to
paths.dat, and there is no need to calculate the XAFS parameters for
this path.  The default for critpw is less than that for critcw since
some paths are more important when the full curved wave calculation is
done than they appear in the plane wave approximation.  Since the plane
wave estimate is extremely fast, use this to filter out as many paths
as you can.  The file crit.dat (written by the module PATHS) tells you
critpw for each path that passes the criterion. </P>
<P>The method of calculation of these importance factors has been improved
for the current release, so don't worry if the values for some paths
has changed slightly from previous versions.

<H3><B>PCRITERIA</B></H3>

<P> keep-criterion heap-criterion</P>
<P>These criteria, like those described in the CRITERIA card, also limit
the number of paths. However, they are applied in the pathfinder and
eliminate unimportant paths while the pathfinder is doing its search.
The pathfinder criteria (pcrit's) do not know the degeneracy of a path
and are therefore much less reliable than the curved wave and plane
wave criteria in the CRITERIA card above. These path finder criteria
(keep and heap) are turned off by default, and we recommend that they
be used only with very large runs, and then with caution. </P>
<P>The keep-criterion looks at the amplitude of chi (in the plane wave
approx) for the current path and compares it to a single scattering
path of the same effective length.  To set this value, consider the
maximum degeneracy you expect and divide your plane wave criterion by
this number.  For example, in fcc Cu, typical degeneracies are 196 for
paths with large r, and the minimum degeneracy is 6.  So a keep
criterion of 0.08% is appropriate for a pw criteria of 2.5%. </P>
<P>The heap-criterion filters paths as the pathfinder puts all paths into
a heap (a partially ordered data structure), then removes them in order
of increasing total path length.  Each path that is removed from the
heap is modified and then considered again as part of the search
algorithm. The heap filter is used to decide if a path has enough
amplitude in it to be worth further consideration.  If we can eliminate
a path at this point, entire trees of derivative paths can be
neglected, leading to enormous time savings.  This test does not come
into play until paths with at least 4 legs are being considered, so
single scattering and triangular (2 and 3 legged) paths will always
pass this test.  Because only a small part of a path is used for this
criterion, it is difficult to predict what appropriate values will be.
To use this (it is only necessary if your heap is filling up, and if
limiting rmax doesn't help), study the results in crit.dat from runs
with shorter rmax and experiment with the heap criterion accordingly.
In the future, we hope to improve this filter. </P>
<P>Before using these criterion, study the output in the file crit.dat
(use print option 1 for paths, see PRINT card), which has the values of
critpw, keep factor and heap factor for all paths which pass the critpw
filter. </P>
<P>Default:  If this card is omitted, the keep and heap criteria are set
to zero, that is, no filtering will be done at this step in the calculation.</P>

potential for such a path. The parameters are a shell index, which is a
label used for feffNNNN.dat file name, a unique potential index ipot,
identifying the unique potential of atom from which to scatter, the
degeneracy, i.e., the multiplicity  of this single scattering path, and
the distance to central atom, rss. This could be used to add single
scattering beyond the limits of a cluster.  </P>

<P>The XANES card is used when a calculation of the near edge structure
including the atomic background and absolute energies are desired. </P>
<P>The XANES calculation is limited to the (extended) continuum spectrum
beyond the Fermi level. Thus bound states are not generally included;
however, in molecules weakly bound states that are below vacuum but
above the muffin-tin zero show up as resonances.  The absolute
energies are based on atomic total energy calculations using the
Desclaux code; the accuracy of this approximation varies from a few
eV to a few hundred eV for very large Z.
No parameters are needed.  Default: XANES not calculated. </P>

<P> ixc vr0 vi0</P>

<P>The EXCHANGE card specifies the energy dependent exchange correlation
potential to be used.  (See also the 
<A HREF="#cor">CORRECTIONS</A> card which is similar
but allows the user to refine values of vr0 and vi0 after a calculation
is completed.)  The EXCHANGE card contains the index of the xc pot (ixc)
and the constant imaginary part of the self-energy (vi0). The
Hedin-Lundqvist self-energy (default) appears to be the best choice for
all applications we have tested in detail. Partially nonlocal model gave
better results for Cu metal, but was not tested on other materials. Broadened
plasmon model removes singular behavior of HL self energy around
plasmon frequency, and it is being tested too. Optionally one may use the
Dirac-Hara exchange correlation potential and an appropriate imaginary
potential vi0. This may be useful to correct FEFF's typical error of
2 eV (high) in the location of the Fermi level and to add instrumental
broadening.  The models with ixc greater or equal to 10 are
still experimental. They need a special file (bphl.dat), which can be obtained
from the authors. Defaults if EXCHANGE card is omitted: ixc=0
(Hedin-Lundquist), vr0=0.0 vi0=0.0.  </P>

<P> ipot ionization</P>
<P>The ION card ionizes all atoms with atom type ipot.  Negative values
and non-integers are permitted (however, ionicities larger than 2 and less
than -1 seems to be very unphysical). The ION card is used to ionize all
atoms of a particular potential index. For example, for diatomics like
Br2, the fully relaxed configuration has ionization=1 on the scattering
atom. The ionization card should be used with caution; because of
charge transfer, the actual degree of ionization is not directly
related to the chemical valence. The default (non-ionized) scattering
potentials are often superior to those empirically ionized, and the
results should be checked both ways. Defaults if ION cards are
omitted: atoms are not ionized.  </P>

<H3><B>OVERLAP</B></H3>

<P> iph</P>
<P>The OVERLAP card contains information needed to construct the
overlapped atom potentials when atomic coordinates are not known or
specified. If the atomic positions are listed following the ATOMS
cards, the OVERLAP cards are probably not needed. The OVERLAP card
contains the potential index of the atom being overlapped and must be
followed by cards specifying the potential index, number of atoms of a
given type to be overlapped and and their distance to the atom being
overlapped.  This option can be useful in crystals, especially for
distant shells -- see sample input files for an example. It can also be
useful for calculating single scattering XAFS in very complex materials
where very little is known about the structure. </P>
<P>You should verify that the coordination chemistry built in using the
OVERLAP cards is realistic; it is important to specify all the close
neighbors of a typical atom in the shell to be overlapped. The most
important factor in determining the scattering amplitudes is the atomic
number of the scatterer, but the coordination chemistry must be
approximately correct to ensure good scattering potentials. Thus it is
important to specify as accurately as possible the coordination
environment of the scatterer.  </P>

<P> dpas</P>
<P>The radial grid used for the potential and phase shift calculation is
r(i) = exp (-8.8 + (i-1) * dpas), with dpas = 0.05.  This is sufficient
for almost everything.  There are occasionally convergence problems in
the background at very high energy (the background curves upward) and
in calculating phase shifts at high energy for very large atoms.
If the background at high energies is not monotonic or chi has unphysical
oscillations, we suggest reducing
the dpas to .03 or .01. It  will solve these problems at the cost of longer
computation times (time is proportional to 1/dpas**2).
We have used this option for testing convergence.</P>

<P>Order of the approximation to use in module GENFMT.  We use order 2,
which is correct to terms of order (1/pR)**2, and corresponds to 6x6
matrices. However, we do single scattering exactly.  This approximation
is accurate to within a few percent in every case we have tried (that
is, higher order doesn't change the result more than a few percent).
Changing the default values requires some familiarity with the
Rehr-Albers paper and the structure of  the module GENFMT.  To do so,
follow the instructions in subroutine SETLAM.  Iord is passed to setlam
for processing.  You may need to change the code parameter lamtot if
you want to do higher order calculations.  This is another of the
arcane cards that we have used for testing.  For details of the
algorithm used by GENFMT, see the paper by J.J.Rehr and R.C.Albers (see
