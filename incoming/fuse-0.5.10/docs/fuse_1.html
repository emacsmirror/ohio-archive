<P>
This document describes the installation and use of
@fuse{}.  @fuse{} is the FEFF/UWXAFS System for
Emacs.  It is a user interface for FEFF, ATOMS, AUTOBK,
FEFFIT and a few other programs developed by the members and
former members of the x-ray absorption spectroscopy group at the
University of Washington.

</P>
<P>
This document is written with the assumption that the reader is familiar
with EXAFS analysis, the use of FEFF and the UWXAFS programs,
and the use of Emacs.  It is not expected that the reader is a guru in
any of these topics, but a certain knowlege of each is necessary as
their basic concepts will not be explained here.

</P>
<P>
There are two companion documents to this one.  One of these is a
tutorial, see section `Introduction' in <CITE>The Fuse Tutorial</CITE>, and
demonstrates the use of @fuse{} by walking you through an analysis of
copper metal using @fuse{} along with FEFF and the UWXAFS
programs.  The other is a quick reference card, <TT>`quickref.ps'</TT>,
which describes the key sequences and user configurable variables in
@fuse{}.  These three documents together provide a complete reference to
@fuse{}.

</P>

<P>
The general purpose of a user interface to these (or any) programs is to
to add value to the programs by making their use easier and more
efficient.  To this end, I have broken down the interface to FEFF
and the UWXAFS programs into five conceptual areas of
functionality.  These are

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Generation of input files</STRONG>
<DD>
  The input structures to these programs are rather complicated and
offer many options for the user.  This is particularly true for
FEFFIT, which uses a highly abstracted metalanguage for
constraining parameters in a fitting model.  Much of the functionality
of @fuse{} is dedicated to the generation and manipulation of the
constituent text of these input files.  The creation of input files is
the most difficult part of using these programs even though the input
files are composed entirely of ASCII text.  Thus I was motivated to use
Emacs as the application/program interface.  Along with good integration
of system level features such as file handling and process handling,
Emacs possesses extremely powerful text manipulation capabilities and a
flexible keyboard and mouse based user model.

<DT><STRONG>Program execution</STRONG>
<DD>
 @fuse{} uses the Emacs system interface to execute the programs and to
display their run-time messages.  Although each of the programs requires
that input files have filenames specific to the program (i.e. FEFF
requires that its input file be called <TT>`feff.inp'</TT>), @fuse{} allows
you to use input files with arbitrary names.  It uses a command wrapper
to temporarily rename files to the name expected by the executed
program.

<DT><STRONG>Organization of graphical output</STRONG>
<DD>
 @fuse{} uses GNUPLOT to display data.  Scripts for running
GNUPLOT are generated automatically from the contents of the input
files and may be saved for future use.  Many display options exist for
FEFFIT for plotting results in different spaces and for plotting
the contributions from individual scattering paths.

<DT><STRONG>Organization of textual output</STRONG>
<DD>
 Analysis of data is performed to obtain answers to physical questions.
Pretty pictures are very important, but often a number is the bottom
line.  @fuse{} has several features for organizing the textual output of
the programs into useful formats.

<DT><STRONG>Error handling and recovery from mistakes</STRONG>
<DD>
 Any program that can be used can be misused.  @fuse{} has features for
examining the contents of input files for errors or inconsistencies.  It
also allows the user to examine the run-time and saved-file output of
the programs.

</DL>

<P>

<P>
@fuse{} is an ongoing project.  I hope that, in its present form, it
will help you analyze your data.  For some hints of what @fuse{} might do
in the future, take a peek at section <A HREF="fuse_6.html#SEC24">Future work</A>.  If you have any questions,
comments, complaints, or suggestions, please contact me.  There is a bug
report function built into @fuse{} which sends me email using the Emacs
mailer.  It is invoked by <KBD>C-c C-b b</KBD> of from the <CODE>Input -
miscellaneous</CODE> menu.  Use that function or any of my contact information
shown on the second page of this document.
