<P>
There are many features of @fuse{} that I have not covered in this
tutorial.  This tutorial is only intended as an introduction to @fuse{}.
Once you have worked through the tutorial, I encourage you play around
with @fuse{}.  Try out the various functions in the <SAMP>`Input'</SAMP> and
program menus.  Click on things and see what happens.  I guarantee that
you will find nifty little features that you will end up using on a
regular basis.

Here is an incomplete and unordered list of things to explore:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Customization</STRONG>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
 <A NAME="IDX103"></A>
 
Versions of Emacs and XEmacs numbered in the 20's come with a
hypertextual customization package.  With it, you can point and click to
customize Emacs packages.  Hit <KBD>C-c C-b c</KBD> or choose <SAMP>`Customize
FUSE'</SAMP> from the <SAMP>`Input - Miscellaneous'</SAMP> menu.  This will open up a
customization buffer for variables in @fuse{}.  Customizing these
variables will allow you to control dozens of features regarding the
appearence and behavior of @fuse{} and it interaction with other
packages and programs.

<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<DT><STRONG>The FUSE command wrapper</STRONG>
<DD>
Although FEFF and the UWXAFS programs require that input files
be named according to their program, @fuse{} does not require this.  You
can call you input files anything you want.  For example, you might have
called the FEFFIT input file from this tutorial <TT>`cu.inp'</TT>.
Before executing the program, @fuse{} will rename the input to the name
exected by the program.  When the program is finished, @fuse{} renames
it back.  Care is taken not to overwrite any existing files.  @fuse{}
also renames the log files<A NAME="DOCF6" HREF="fuse-tutorial_foot.html#FOOT6">(6)</A> does <EM>not</EM>
currently rename the output files from FEFF.} written by the
programs.  In the case of <TT>`cu.inp'</TT>, @fuse{} would rename the log
and prm files <TT>`cu.log'</TT> and <TT>`cu.prm'</TT>.

<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
<A NAME="IDX106"></A>
<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Include files</STRONG>
<DD>
FEFFIT and AUTOBK allow the use of include files.  @fuse{} has
many features for working with include files.  Most importantly, it
allows you to assign a master file to each include file using <KBD>C-c
C-d m</KBD> or <SAMP>`Set master file'</SAMP> from the <SAMP>`Imput - Set variables'</SAMP>
menu.  Once the master file is assigned, functions for running programs,
looking at log files, and others do <EM>the right thing</EM>.

<A NAME="IDX108"></A>
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Tag files</STRONG>
<DD>
When using include files in FEFFIT, it can be easy to forget in
which file variables are defined.  In <SAMP>`feffit mode'</SAMP> you can create
a tag file which cross references variables with their location of
definition.  Once the tag file is created with <KBD>C-c C-f t</KBD>, you can
place the screen cursor on a variable name in a math expression and type
<KBD>M-.</KBD>.  The display will switch to the place where that variable is
defined.

<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Paragraph manipulation</STRONG>
<DD>
In the chapter on FEFFIT (see section <A HREF="fuse-tutorial_5.html#SEC16">Running Feffit</A>) we used the
paragraph manipulation function for adding a parameter to each
paragraph.  There are also functions for renumbering paragraphs,
deleting parameters, and commenting out and uncommenting parameters.
These functions work on every paragraph in the file.  If you preceed the
key sequence or menu selection with <KBD>C-u</KBD> then the paragraph
manipulation function will start working from the current screen
position rather than on the entire file.

<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Cleaning</STRONG>
<DD>
@fuse offers functions for standardizing the appearence of your input
files by indenting lines and separating columns as specified by the
appropriate variables.

<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<DT><STRONG>Editing shortcuts</STRONG>
<DD>
Lots of repetitive tasks are automated by @fuse{}.  In AUTOBK and
FEFFIT there are functions for filling in keyword values by
snagging values from similar keywords in surrounding stanzas and
paragraphs.  There are also functions for swapping the words <SAMP>`set'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`guess'</SAMP> in a FEFFIT input file, for swapping boolean
values, and for commenting and uncommenting single lines or blocks of
text.
