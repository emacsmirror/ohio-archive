<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Conceptual description</A></H2>


<P>This section describes the various modules and outlines the use of the
code. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Scattering potential and phase shift code, POTPH </A></H2>


<P>The potentials of each atomic type are calculated as if the atoms were 
isolated in space using a relativistic Dirac-Fock Desclaux atom 
code.  The scattering potentials are calculated by overlapping the 
free atom densities within the muffin tin approximation (Mattheiss 
prescription), and including the Hedin-Lundqvist/Quinn self energy for 
excited states.  Muffin-tin radii are determined automatically from 
calculated Norman radii and scattering phase shifts are determined by 
matching at the muffin tin radius.  XAFS spectra are referenced to the 
threshold Fermi level, which is estimated by electron gas theory at the 
mean interstitial density.  Atomic configurations and core-hole lifetimes 
are built in, and mean free paths are determined from the imaginary part 
of the average interstitial potential. Dipole matrix elements are
calculated using atomic core and normalized continuum wavefunctions.
An absolute energy scale is obtained by a Desclaux-atom calculation of
the total energy of the system with and without the core-hole.
Polarization dependence is optionally incorporated in the
dipole-operator.   </P>
<P>The free atomic potentials need as input only the atomic number of the atoms,
and, for the absorbing atom, the type of the core hole being considered. To 
do the overlapping for the unique potentials, the neighboring atoms must 
be identified, either by position (from a list of the cartesian
coordinates of each atom) or by explicit overlapping instructions. </P>
<P>To save time the code calculates the overlapped atom potential for each
unique potential only once, using as a sample geometry the atom
with the unique potential index that is closest to the absorbing atom.
Thus it is essential that the neighborhood of that sample atom be correct.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Path enumeration, PATHS</A></H2>

<P>The code uses a constructive algorithm with several path importance
filters to explore all significant multiple-scattering paths in order
of increasing path length, based on a list of atomic coordinates.
An efficient degeneracy checker is used to identify equivalent
paths (based on similar geometry, path reversal symmetry, and space
inversion symmetry). To avoid roundoff errors, the degeneracy checker
is conservative, very occasionally thinking that two degenerate paths
are not degenerate.  These errors occur in the third or fourth decimal
place (less than 0.001 Ang) and fail safe, that is, no paths will be lost.</P>
<P>The criteria used in filtering are based on increasingly accurate
estimates of each path's amplitude.  The earliest filters, the
pathfinder heap and keep filters, are applied as the paths are being
created.  A plane wave filter based on the plane wave approximation
(plus a curved wave correction for multiple-scattering paths) and
accurate to about 30% is applied after the paths have been enumerated
and sorted.  Finally, and accurate curved wave filter is applied to
all remaining paths. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Scattering amplitude and other XAFS parameter calculation, GENFMT</A></H2>


<P>For each path the code calculates the effective scattering amplitude
(|f_eff| from which FEFF gets its name; see 6.11),
total scattering phase shift and
other XAFS parameters using the scattering matrix algorithm of Rehr and
Albers.  Once the scattering phase shifts and the paths are determined,
no other input is necessary for this calculation. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 XAFS spectrum calculation, FF2CHI</A></H2>

<P>The code ff2chi constructs the XAFS spectrum chi(k) (See 6.11) using the XAFS
parameters from one or more paths.  Single and multiple scattering
Debye-Waller factors are calculated using a correlated Debye model.
Output from this module is the total XAFS spectrum and optionally, the
contribution to the XAFS from each path individually.  Numerous
options for filtering, Debye-Waller factors, and other corrections
are available at this point.  See descriptions of input cards below.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Calculation Strategy</A></H2>

<P>The scattering phase shifts for each unique potential are necessary for
both PATHS and GENFMT.  They are used for the importance filters in
PATHS and are the basis of the XAFS parameters calculation in GENFMT.
This part of the calculation can be slow, so it is usually best to run
it only once and use the results while studying the paths and XAFS. </P>
<P>To study the necessary paths, the pathfinder module PATHS will need the
atomic positions of any atoms from which scattering is expected.  If
the structure is completely unknown, single-scattering paths can be
created explicitly.  Because the number of possible paths increases
exponentially with total path length, start with a short total path
length, study the few paths (representing scattering from the nearest
neighbors), and gradually increase the total path length, possibly
studying the path importance coefficients and using the filters to
limit the number of paths.  This process is not automated, and if done
carelessly can yield so many paths that no analysis will be possible. </P>
<P>Finally, use GENFMT to calculate the XAFS parameters, and FF2CHI to
assemble the results into a chi curve.  Here, the slow part is GENFMT 
and FF2CHI is very fast.  Therefore, to explore parameters such as
Debye-Waller factors, mean free path and energy zero shifts, various
combinations of paths and coordination numbers, run only module FF2CHI
using the results saved from GENFMT. </P>
<P>There are three ways to modify the Debye-Waller factor, all of which affect
only the module FF2CHI.  The DEBYE card uses the correlated Debye model
to calculate a Debye-Waller factor for each path.  The SIG2 card adds
a constant Debye-Waller factor to each path.  And you can edit list.dat
to add a particular Debye-Waller factor to a particular path.  These three
Debye-Waller factors are summed, so if the DEBYE and SIG2 cards are present,
and if you have added a Debye-Waller factor to a particular path, the Debye-
Waller factor used will be the sum of all three.  See documentation below
for details.</P>
<P>If your model changes significantly, the phase shifts (which are based
in part on the structure of the material) will have to be recalculated.
Any time the phase shifts change, the XAFS parameters will have to be
re-calculated.  If the path filters have been used, the path list will
also have to be recomputed. </P>
