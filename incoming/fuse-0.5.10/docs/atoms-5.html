<P>Here is an example of <SF>atoms</SF> in action.  The material is Lead
Titanate, PbTiO3. The crystallographic literature places this material
in the tetragonal space group <CODE>P 4 M M</CODE>.  The data was taken in
fluorescence at the titanium K-edge.  Since the edge energy is around
5 KeV and the sample was very thick, the I0 and self-absorption
corrections are expected to be significant.  That titanium is the
central atom is indicated by the keyword <CODE>core</CODE>.  <SF>atoms</SF>
assumes the K-edge of the titanium was probed because the atomic
number of titanium is less than 57 and the edge was not otherwise
chosen with the <CODE>edge</CODE> keyword.  The I0 chamber was filled with
92% helium and 8% nitrogen by pressure.  This is
indicated by the <CODE>nitrogen</CODE> keyword.  The indexing feature is
engaged with the <CODE>index</CODE> keyword.  The size of the cluster to be
printed in <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> is chosen with the <CODE>rmax</CODE> keyword.</P>

<P><SF>atoms</SF> produces the output reproduced below.  The absorption and
correction calculations are at the top of the file.  All the
<CODE>CONTROL</CODE> cards are set to 1 and the <CODE>PRINT</CODE> cards are set to 0.
This will run all four modules of <SF>feff</SF> and produce the default
output files.  Several other useful <SF>feff</SF> cards are printed but
commented out by an asterisk (<CODE>*</CODE>).  The unique potential list is
constructed in a simple fashion -- the core atom is potential 0 and
each different atomic species has a single potential.  The atom list
is printed in the format required by <SF>feff</SF>.  The atom list has two
comment columns.  The indexed atomic symbol and radial distance are
written by <SF>atoms</SF> for your use when reading <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> and are
ignored by <SF>feff</SF>.</P>
<P><SF>feff</SF> will run to completion using the input file generated by
<SF>atoms</SF>.  It is still likely that the user will want to edit
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE>. Several assumptions are made by <SF>atoms</SF>
that might not hold true.  The assignment of unique potentials is made
by a simple algorithm and may not adequately reflect the physics of
the problem.  The <CODE>CONTROL</CODE> cards are such that all four modules of
<SF>feff</SF> will be run.  The <SF>feff</SF> user might want to run
the modules separately.  Values for other cards have been assumed and
might not be desired.  Other cards have been left out entirely.
Always check your <CODE>feff.inp</CODE> file to be sure it is just
what you want. </P>
