<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC3">Unpacking the distribution</A></H2>

<P>
@fuse{} is distributed in two compressed archive formats.  One uses
the standard unix TAR and GZIP utilities, the other uses
ZIP.  Their contents are the same.  Use whichever one is more
convenient for you.

</P>
<P>
You can unpack the distribution any place on your disk.  One of the
steps of the installation discussed in See section <A HREF="fuse_2.html#SEC4">Configuring, making, and installing.</A> will move all of
the necessary files to their final home.  To unpack the TARred and
GZIPped file, <CODE>cd</CODE> to your lisp directory and execute these
commands:

<PRE>
    &#62; gunzip fuse.tar.gz
    &#62; tar xvf fuse.tar
</PRE>

<P>
To unpack the ZIPped file, execute this commands:

<PRE>
    &#62; unzip fuse.zip
</PRE>

<P>
After doing one of those steps, you will find that the @fuse{}
distribution has been unpacked into a subdirectory called
<TT>`fuse-#.#.#'</TT>, where the <TT>`#'</TT> signs denote the current version
number of @fuse{}.

</P>
<P>
Now <KBD>cd</KBD> into the <TT>`fuse-#.#.#'</TT> subdirectory.  Here is what you
will find in that directory.

<UL>

<LI>

Several information files and scripts used during installation, including:
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`Makefile.emacs'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`Makefile.xemacs'</TT>
<DD>
The instructions for the MAKE program, one for Emacs and one for XEmacs.
<DT><TT>`configure'</TT>
<DD>
A Bourne shell script used to configure the distribution for your
machine.  See section <A HREF="fuse_2.html#SEC4">Configuring, making, and installing.</A>.
<DT><TT>`INSTALL'</TT>
<DD>
A file with the installation instructions from section <A HREF="fuse_2.html#SEC4">Configuring, making, and installing.</A>.
<DT><TT>`README'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`COPYING'</TT>
<DD>
<DT><TT>`HOOKS'</TT>
<DD>
Some files with general information about @fuse{}.

</DL>

<LI>

A bunch of files that end in <TT>`.el'</TT>.  These are the main programs in
@fuse{}.

<LI>

The <TT>`docs/'</TT> directory contains documentation for @fuse{} as well as
for ATOMS and FEFF in a variety of formats, including info,
html, PostScript and plain text.  You will also find quick reference
cards in PostScript format for @fuse{} and GNUPLOT here.

<LI>

The <TT>`pixmaps/'</TT> directory contains all of the icons used in the
toolbars.

<LI>

The <TT>`scripts/'</TT> directory contains several shell and perl scripts
used by @fuse{}.

<LI>

The <TT>`fortran/'</TT> directory contains some programs useful for handling
UWXAFS binary files as well as copies of the programs NORMAL
for normalization and alignment of absorption data, and PHIT, a
general purpose fitting program.

<LI>

The <TT>`emulation/'</TT> directory contains some files useful if you want
Emacs to emulate VI, EDT, or CRISP while using @fuse{}.

<LI>

The <TT>`example/'</TT> directory contains files that you will need for the
tutorial, see section `Introduction' in <CITE>The Fuse Tutorial</CITE>, and various
example input files demonstrating features of @fuse{}.

</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC4">Configuring, making, and installing.</A></H2>

<P>
Before starting, you need to decide on a few things.  During the first step
in the installation process, you will be asked a few questions that
@fuse{} needs to know to install itself properly.  These are

<OL>
<LI>

Will you be using Emacs or XEmacs?<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="fuse_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>.  XEmacs
refers to the version from @url{http://www.xemacs.org}.}
<LI>

In which directory will you be installing @fuse{}?  If you are
installing @fuse{} as a normal user, then this should be a directory
where you keep personal Emacs lisp files.  If you are installing
@fuse{} as root, then this should be the <TT>`site-lisp'</TT> directory.
Telling the wrong place to the installation script will result in
@fuse{} not being accessible to Emacs.
<LI>

What is the location of perl on your computer?  The <TT>`configure'</TT>
script will most likely be able to determine this, but if it fails you
will need to supply its location.  Perl is required to properly install
various scripts the @fuse{} uses to plot data and perform other chores.
You can determine its location by <KBD>which perl</KBD> under tcsh or
<KBD>type perl</KBD> under bash.
<LI>

Do you want the installation script to edit your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file so
that @fuse{} is automatically used with input files.  To do so the
script will write several lines to your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file.  If you have
previously installed @fuse{} then it is probably safe to answer no to
this question.  If you are installing this as root, you will have to
edit the <TT>`site-start.el'</TT> file by hand with the lines printed to the
screen at the end of the configuration step.<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="fuse_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A> will handle this for the root installation, but the current
version does not.}

</OL>

<P>
Once you have decided on these points, type <KBD>configure</KBD> at the
command line.  This is an interactive script that asks you for the
answers to the questions.  Just follow the instructions printed on the
screen.

</P>
<P>
Once the configuration is done, type <KBD>make</KBD> then <KBD>make
install</KBD>.  Please note that if the location where you intend to have
@fuse{} installed is the same as the place where you unpacked it, you
should skip the <CODE>make install</CODE> step.  Nothing bad will happen if
you don't skip it, but you will get a lot of non-critical but alarming
looking error messages.<A NAME="DOCF3" HREF="fuse_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>

</P>

<P>
The lines that are added to the <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file look something like
this, with <CODE>~/lisp/fuse/</CODE> replaced by the installation location on
your computer:

<PRE>
       (setq load-path
             (append (list "~/lisp/fuse/" ) load-path))
       (setq auto-mode-alist
             (append (list (cons "\\.inp$" 'input-mode))
                     auto-mode-alist))
       (autoload 'fuse-mode "fuse" t)
       (autoload 'input-mode "input" t)
       (add-hook 'dired-load-hook
                 '(lambda () (load-library "fuse-dired")))
</PRE>

<P>
The first two lines tell emacs where to find @fuse{}.  The next three
lines tells Emacs to use @fuse{} for files ending in <TT>`.inp'</TT>.  The
two <SAMP>`autoload'</SAMP> lines tell Emacs how to start using @fuse{}.  The
last allows for batch processing of input files using dired mode in
Emacs.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC5">Customizing FUSE</A></H2>

<P>
There are lots of variables which can be set to customize the appearance
and behavior of @fuse{}.  The variables are listed in the quick
reference card which comes with @fuse{} or can be listed using the
<SAMP>`variable apropos'</SAMP> function in Emacs or the <SAMP>`hyper apropos'</SAMP>
function in XEmacs.  There are at least four ways to do so, some more
convenient than others.

</P>


<OL>

<LI>

At any time while using @fuse{}, you can type <KBD>M-x set-variable</KBD> and
respond with the name of the variable you want to change and the value
you want to change it too.  This solution, however, does not last
between Emacs sessions.  To make a permanent change you need to do one
of the other things in this list.

<LI>

Add lines to your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file.  Take a look at the file
<TT>`dot-emacs'</TT> that comes with @fuse{} for an example of this.  The
best way to set a user variable in <TT>`.emacs'</TT> is

<PRE>
       (add-hook 'fuse-mode-hook '(lambda ()
                (setq input-comment-char "% ")
                (setq input-stanza-indent 2)   ))
</PRE>

In this example I set two user variables to their default values.
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>

<LI>

Create a file called <TT>`.fuse'</TT>.  This file is read when a buffer
first enters Input mode.  It contains Emacs lisp statements for setting
the values of the variables.  An example of a <TT>`.fuse'</TT> file is given
with the @fuse{} distribution in a file called <TT>`dot-fuse'</TT>.  In this
example, every user configurable is set to its default value.  The lines
of the <TT>`.fuse'</TT> file look like these two:

<PRE>
  (setq input-comment-char "% ")
  (setq input-stanza-indent 2)
</PRE>

This is a little redundant with the <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file, but it is
convenient to have another place to put your @fuse{} customizations and
keep clutter out of <TT>`.emacs'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>

<LI>

If you are using GNU Emacs 20 or XEmacs 20, or if you have the
<TT>`custom'</TT> package specially installed for version 19 of either
program, you can use it to set and save changes to @fuse{}'s user
variables.  This is the easiest way of customizing @fuse{} or any other
Emacs package.  Just type <KBD>M-x customize-group</KBD> and answer
<KBD>fuse</KBD>.  You will then be presented with a hypertext buffer for
setting the @fuse{} user variables.  @fuse{} is in the <VAR>Local</VAR>
customization group.
