<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Run Control Options</A></H2>



<P>In addition to the CONTROL card and the FEFF options in feff.inp, some
parameters in the files read by the various modules can be changed.
For example, you can create your own paths by editing paths.dat and
change explicit Debye-Waller factors in the final result by editing
list.dat. </P>
<P>Users may edit the some files as a quick and sometimes convenient way
to prepare a given run.  It is easiest to use an existing file as a
template -- these files are read by a computer program that is fussy
about what it receives. </P>
<P>The files that can be used in this way are paths.dat and list.dat. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Paths.dat</A></H2>

<P>You can modify a path, or even invent new ones.  For example, you could
make a path to determine the effect of a focusing atom on a distant
scatterer. Whatever index you enter for the path will be used in the
filename given to the feffnnnn.dat file; i.e., for the choice, index =
845,  the exafs parameters will appear in feff0845.dat. </P>
<P>A handy way to add a single scattering path of length R is to make a
2-leg path with the central atom at (0, 0, 0) and the scatterer at
(R, 0, 0). </P>
<P>GENFMT will need the positions, unique potentials, and character tags
for each atom in the path.  The angles and leg lengths are printed out
for your information, and you can omit them when creating your own
paths by hand.  The label lines in the file are required (there is code
that skips them, and if they're missing, you'll get wrong results). </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 list.dat</A></H2>

<P>This is the list of files that ff2chi uses to calculate chi.  It
includes the paths written by module
GENFMT, curved wave importance factors, and user-defined Debye-Waller
factors.  If you want to set Debye-Waller factors for individual paths,
you may edit this file to set them.  FF2CHI will sum the Debye-Waller
factors in this file with the correlated Debye
model sig2 and the global sig2, if present.  You may also delete
paths from this file if you want to
combine some particular set of paths.  (CAUTION: Save the original, or you'll
have to re-run GENFMT!) </P>
