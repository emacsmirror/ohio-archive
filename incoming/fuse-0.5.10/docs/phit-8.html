<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Appendix:  Some Worked Examples</A></H2>


<P>The examples in this appendix are from version 0.11 of <SF>Phit</SF>.
Some features of these examples might not be consistent with later
versions.  Chapters 3 and 4 are updated more often than is this
appendix.  </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 Fitting a Line + a Gaussian + Noise</A></H2>


<P>This example fits a simple sum of two line shapes, a line and Gaussian.
The line has a slope of 3.2 and a y-intercept of -77.1.  The Gaussian
is centered at 55, has a width of 5, and an amplitude of 886.23.  On top
of this was placed noise from a pseudo-random number generator with
rms amplitude of 7.071. </P>
<P>Here is the input file for this fitting:

<P>In this input file, the input data is identified as <CODE>noisy.dat</CODE>
with the keyword <CODE>data</CODE>.  The input file format is ASCII.  This
need not be specified since ASCII input is the default.  Had the data
been in a UWXAFS file then <CODE>format=uwxafs</CODE> would have been
specified and the <CODE>nkey</CODE> or <CODE>skey</CODE> would have been provided.
The label for the xaxis is <CODE>zeta</CODE>.  This is used in the math
expressions below.  Since the word <CODE>all</CODE> is in the input file,
files containing the best fit line and the best fit Gaussian will be
written as well as one containing the sum of the line and the
Gaussian.  The fit will be performed over the entire input data range.
Were the <CODE>x1</CODE> and <CODE>x2</CODE> keywords not commented out, the fit would
include only those points between the values of 20 and 80 on the input
x axis.</P>
<P>Five guess values are set.  These correspond to the slope and
y-intercept of the line and the center, height, and width of the
Gaussian.  The zeta dependent part of the line is introduced as the
set value <CODE>line</CODE>.  Finally the functions to be summed are
defined at the bottom of the input file.  Each function has an
<CODE>id</CODE> line associated with it.  Note that the functions do not
have to be sequentially numbered. </P>
<P>Here is the data and fit for this example.  (Picture goes here.)</P>

</P>
<P>You will notice that it did an excellent job determining the values of
the parameters.  Also the estimation of sigma was a little low, but
reasonable.  This is a good fit, not only by the excellent
determination of the parameters, but also by the chi-square and
R-factor tests.</P>
<P>What happens if <CODE>sigdat</CODE> is set to 7.07, the rms noise value place
on the data?  Call <I>R</I> is the ratio of <CODE>sigdat</CODE> to the sigma
from the residuals, <I>R</I> = 7.07/5.72 = 1.24.  Normalized chi-square
will be reduced by a factor of <I>R</I>&circ;2 and the error bars increased
by a factor of <I>R</I>.</P>
<P>One final note about this fit.  A good initial guess for <CODE>e0</CODE> was
needed.  Guessing 45 is a poor enough initial guess that the
minimization algorithm is unable to determine the best fit.  This is
because, at values far from the proper center, the gaussian function
is very insensitive to small changes in value for the center.  Thus
the algorithm is unable to determine how to change this parameter to
improve the fit.  Close initial guesses are not always necessary, but
are often prudent.</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Fitting An Einstein Temperature to XAFS Debye-Waller Factors</A></H2>


<P>A single frequency model for displacement about bond lengths as
measured by XAFS is usually successful.  In this example, I fit a
single Einstein temperature to mean square displacements as determined
from XAFS analysis at 10 temperatures.  The material is the YBCO
superconductor and the scattering path that produced these data was a
single scattering path between copper and barium.  Here is the input

<P>The x-axis label is chosen to be <CODE>t</CODE> as this is data in
temperature.  The measurement uncertainties are provided in the file
cb.dat and will be used in the minimization and error analysis.  The
Einstein function for mean square displacement depends upon
temperature, theta (the Einstein temperature), and the reduced mass of
the two atoms.  In <SF>Phit</SF>, the reduced mass is in
atomic units.  Theta is varied to produce the best fit. </P>

<P>The fitting range is limited by the keywords <CODE>x1</CODE> and
<CODE>x2</CODE>.  The output data will be written only over the fitting
range, as specified by the keyword <CODE>write</CODE>.  Since the data
is an entire XAFS scan and extends for hundreds of eV below and above
the edge, it would be unnecessary to write the fit out to the full
data range.  All of the individual functions will be written to data
files.  </P>
<P>My variables include the width, center, and amplitude of the
arctangent and the widths and amplitudes of the gaussians.  I have
fixed the centers of the gaussians at the energy value of the highest
point of each peak in the data set.  Note in the picture below that
the energy scale of this scan is shifted relative to the edge energy
of titanium.  McMaster reports the titanium K edge energy as 4966 eV.
In this scan the edge energy is about 4980.  This most likely means
that the monochromator software was reporting a constant offset when
translating monochromator encoder readings into energy values.  This
doesn't effect the analysis in any way.</P>

<P>This seems to be a good fit.  The R-factor is very low, indicating a
small misfit relative to the size of the data.  The chi-square is
nearly 1, which is expected since the standard deviation of the
residual array was used as the measurement uncertainty.</P>
<P>The value for <CODE>e0</CODE>, the center of the arctangent seems to be
a reasonable measure for the edge energy on this shifted scale.  It
is reasonable to call that point in the data the edge energy within
the 1.4 eV uncertainty that <SF>Phit</SF> found. </P>
<P>You will notice in the correlations table that the sixth Gaussian and
the arctangent are highly correlated.  This is reasonable considering
that the fitting range that I chose (in order to illustrate this
point) ends within a half-width of the peak of the sixth Gaussian.
Thus the parameters describing this Gaussian are rather poorly
determined and are very sensitive to the baseline determined by the
height and placement of the arctangent. </P>
