<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Program and file structure</A></H2>


<P>This section describes the files and data used by the various modules.
The main program FEFF reads one file created directly by the user, the
file feff.inp;  it is line oriented with a KEYWORD
followed by data in free format.  Case is not significant; ABCDE is
equivalent to abcde or AbcDe.  Tab characters are treated as if they
were blanks.  The routine that reads the input assumes that your machine
uses the ASCII character set.</P>
<P>Comments may be added at the end of any
line after any required data, and spaces between lines are ignored. Any
line beginning with an asterisk (*) is a comment and is ignored.
An auxiliary program (ATOMS) is provided which generates the feff.inp file
from crystallographic input parameters.  </P>
<P>Other files required by the various modules are created by FEFF from
feff.inp.  Some of these other files may be edited by the user as a way
to modify the input data to the modules, see section 5. See the PRINT
card in section 4 to obtain various diagnostic files.  Table 3.1
summarizes this structure, the rest of this section describes the
structure in more detail. </P>

------  -----------     ------------    -------------------
POTPH   feff.inp        phase.bin       diagnostic files
        potph.inp       xsect.bin       (see PRINT card)

        geom.dat

GENFMT  feff.inp        feff.bin
        phase.bin       list.dat
        paths.dat       
        rkk.bin

FF2CHI  feff.inp        chi.dat         chipNNNN.dat
        list.dat        xmu.dat         feffNNNN.dat
        feff.bin
        xsect.bin  
-----------------------------------------------------------
Note that geom.dat is written when feff.inp is read.  If you are
using a hand-made geom.dat (possibly to take advantage of some
symmetry), use the NOGEOM card to prevent your geom.dat from
being overwritten.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Scattering potential and phase shift code, POTPH</A></H2>

<P>Reads potph.inp, which is created by FEFF's input routine from
feff.inp. potph.inp is deleted by FEFF after use.  POTPH writes the
binary file phase.bin, which contains the scattering phase shifts and
other information needed by PATHS and GENFMT. Also, POTPH
prints binary file rkk.bin, which contains dipole matrix elements,
normalized to cross-section data in xsect.bin. The last file is written
only if XANES card is used. Optionally,
POTPH will write other diagnostic files with information about the
potentials and phase shift calculations.  </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Path enumeration, PATHS</A></H2>

<P>Reads geom.dat, which is created by FEFF from the information in
feff.inp, and phase.bin.  geom.dat is deleted after use unless
explicitly saved (see PRINT card).  PATHS writes paths.dat for use by
GENFMT and as a complete description of each path for use of the user.
PATHS will optionally write other diagnostic files.  The file crit.dat
is particularly useful when studying large numbers of paths.  When
studying large numbers of paths, this module will optionally write only
crit.dat and save geom.dat, not writing paths.dat. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Scattering amplitude and other XAFS parameter calculation, GENFMT</A></H2>

<P>GENFMT reads phase.bin, rkk.bin and paths.dat, and writes a file feff.bin
which contains all the EXAFS information for the paths, and list.dat which
tells you some basic information about them.  These files are the main
output of FEFF.  To read feff.bin into your own program, use the
subroutine feffdt as an example.</P>
<P>For compatibility
with older versions, the program can read feff.bin and write
the feffnnnn.dat files and files.dat in module ff2chi, if appropriate
PRINT option was specified. They are exactly like the old
ones.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 XAFS spectrum calculation, FF2CHI</A></H2>

<P>FF2CHI reads list.dat and feff.bin, and writes
chi.dat with the total XAFS from the paths specified in list.dat
Additional instructions
are passed to FF2CHI from feff.inp, so you can change S02, Debye
temperature and some other parameters without re-doing the whole
calculation.  The file list.dat can be edited by hand to change the
paths being considered, and individual chipNNNN.dat files with chi from
each path are optionally written. If the XANES card is specified and
xsect.bin exists, FF2CHI will write the XANES data in xmu.dat.
Various filtering options and corrections are possible at this
point -- see input cards below.</P>
<P>There is an internal limit on the number of paths (set to 1000) that will
be read from feff.bin.  This limit was chosen to handle any reasonable
problem without using an excessive amount of memory.  If you must use
more paths, change the parameter "npx" is subroutine ff2chi to whatever
you need.  It will need more memory.  We have not had a case where
the filter criteria were not able to solve the problem with fewer than
1000 paths. </P>
