`IORDER'
........

   iord

   Order of the approximation to use in module GENFMT.  We use order 2,
which is correct to terms of order (1/pR)**2, and corresponds to 6x6
matrices. However, we do single scattering exactly.  This approximation
is accurate to within a few percent in every case we have tried (that
is, higher order doesn't change the result more than a few percent).
Changing the default values requires some familiarity with the
Rehr-Albers paper and the structure of  the module GENFMT.  To do so,
follow the instructions in subroutine SETLAM.  Iord is passed to setlam
for processing.  You may need to change the code parameter lamtot if
you want to do higher order calculations.  This is another of the
arcane cards that we have used for testing.  For details of the
algorithm used by GENFMT, see the paper by J.J.Rehr and R.C.Albers (see
Appendix C, references).

   Removes jumps in all potentials at muffin-tin radii. This should be
used only for cases when unreasonably big oscillations in smooth atomic
cross section occur (see XANES card). This card may introduce
unphysical energy shifts so it should be used with caution.

`NOHOLE'
........

   What does it mean to do x-ray absorption if no x-ray was absorbed?
Not much, but the code will do it if you want.  We used this to test the
final state rule for calculated XAFS, and to compare to some other
calculations that did not use a core hole.  The code will use the final
state from the hole card for matrix element calculation - the NOHOLE
card says to calculate potentials, etc., as if there was no core hole.

Run Control Options
*******************

   In addition to the CONTROL card and the FEFF options in feff.inp,
some parameters in the files read by the various modules can be changed.
For example, you can create your own paths by editing paths.dat and
change explicit Debye-Waller factors in the final result by editing
list.dat.

   Users may edit the some files as a quick and sometimes convenient way
to prepare a given run.  It is easiest to use an existing file as a
template - these files are read by a computer program that is fussy
about what it receives.

   The files that can be used in this way are paths.dat and list.dat.

* list-dat::


File: feff7.info,  Node: Paths-dat,  Next: list-dat,  Up: Run Control Options

Paths-dat
=========

   You can modify a path, or even invent new ones.  For example, you
could make a path to determine the effect of a focusing atom on a
distant scatterer. Whatever index you enter for the path will be used
in the filename given to the feffnnnn.dat file; i.e., for the choice,
index = 845,  the exafs parameters will appear in feff0845.dat.

   A handy way to add a single scattering path of length R is to make a
2-leg path with the central atom at (0, 0, 0) and the scatterer at (R,
0, 0).

   GENFMT will need the positions, unique potentials, and character tags
for each atom in the path.  The angles and leg lengths are printed out
for your information, and you can omit them when creating your own
paths by hand.  The label lines in the file are required (there is code
that skips them, and if they're missing, you'll get wrong results).


File: feff7.info,  Node: list-dat,  Prev: Paths-dat,  Up: Run Control Options

list-dat
========

   This is the list of files that ff2chi uses to calculate chi.  It
includes the paths written by module GENFMT, curved wave importance
factors, and user-defined Debye-Waller factors.  If you want to set
Debye-Waller factors for individual paths, you may edit this file to
set them.  FF2CHI will sum the Debye-Waller factors in this file with
the correlated Debye model sig2 and the global sig2, if present.  You
may also delete paths from this file if you want to combine some
particular set of paths.  (CAUTION: Save the original, or you'll have
to re-run GENFMT!)

phase-bin
=========

   This is a binary file with the scattering phase shifts for each
unique potential.  It is used by GENFMT and the pathfinder.


File: feff7.info,  Node: paths-dat,  Next: crit-dat,  Prev: phase-bin,  Up: Output files

paths-dat
=========

   Written by the pathfinder, this is a description of all the paths
that fit the criteria used by the pathfinder.  It is used by GENFMT. The
path descriptions include cartesian coordinates of atoms in the path,
scattering angles, leg lengths and degeneracy. For details on editing
this by hand, see section 4.


File: feff7.info,  Node: crit-dat,  Next: geom-dat,  Prev: paths-dat,  Up: Output files

geom-dat
========

   Written by feff for use with the pathfinder, and deleted after use.
It is an atom list created from the user-input list in feff.inp.  For
more information, see the NOGEOM card in section 4.


File: feff7.info,  Node: list-dat,  Next: chi-dat,  Prev: geom-dat,  Up: Output files

list-dat
========

   List of files to use to create chi.dat.  Written by GENFMT when the
xafs parameters are calculated and used by FF2CHI.  This contains the
curved wave importance ratios, which you may wish to study. For details
on editing this by hand, see section 5.

   The curved wave importance ratios are the importance of a particular
path relative to the most important path encountered so far in the
calculation.  If the first path is the most important in the problem,
all the importance factors will be expressed as a fraction of that path.
However, if the third path considered is the most important, and the
first path is the next most important, path 1 will have a factor of
100%, path 2 will be a fraction of the first path's importance, path 3
will have an importance of 100% (since it is now the most important
path), and subsequent paths will be expressed as a percent of path 3's
importance.

feff-bin
========

   A binary file that contains all the information about the XAFS from
all of the paths.  This replaces the old feffNNNN.dat files (which you
can make using the PRINT card).  If you want to use this file with your
own analysis package, use the code in subroutine feffdt as an example
of how to read it.

Appendix B- Installation Instructions
*************************************

   The program FEFF7 is provided as a single source file, which
contains a main program and all necessary subroutines.  Simply compile
and link on your system using a Fortran 77 compiler and your usual
linker.  The executable file produced is all you will need.   The code
requires about 3 megabytes to run on a VAX.  Since most of this memory
is data space, we expect it to require about this amount of memory on
most machines.  PC users, please see section below about DOS machines.

UNIX machines
=============

   We have endeavored to make FEFF portable to most UNIX machines
without any modification.  If your machine does not reproduce the test
output files chi.dat and feffNNNN.dat to high accuracy, some changes
may be needed.  Please report any problems or warning messages to the
authors, as this will help us achieve full portability.  If changes are
needed, keep in mind the following points:

   Floating point calculations must be done to precision 64 bits. Thus
the code uses double precision variables throughout, i.e., real*8 for
real numbers and complex*16 for complex numbers.  If your machine uses 8
bytes for single precision floating point numbers (for example, Crays
and some CDC machines), use the compiler option to ignore double
precision statements in the code. This option is available (in various
forms) on all Cray and CDC machines that we have seen.  On the CRAY YMP
at Ohio State, the compiler option to ignore double precision in the
source code is
           cf77 -c -Wf"-dp"

   Code is written in ANSI FORTRAN 77, except that COMPLEX*16 variables
are required.  Since data type COMPLEX*16 is not part of the ANSI
standard, minor compiler-dependent modification may be necessary.  We
have used the VAX extensions to ANSI FORTRAN 77 since they seem to be
the most portable.  The non-standard statements and intrinsic functions
used are: COMPLEX*16 variables and arrays; DIMAG(arg) returns a double
precision imaginary part of arg; DCMPLX(arg) returns a complex*16
version of arg; DBLE(arg) returns a double precision real part of arg;
SQRT, EXP, ABS and other generic math functions are assumed to accept
complex*16 arguments and return double precision or complex*16 results.

   Files are opened with the OPEN statement.  As the ANSI definition
gives some leeway in how the OPEN statement interacts with the operating
system, we have chosen file names and conventions that work on UNIX,
VAX/VMS, IBM PCs (and clones) with MS FORTRAN, CRAY, MAC's and and CDC
machines.  It may be necessary to modify the open statements on other
systems.

PC users
========

   Because of the awkwardness of DOS, many users do not have FORTRAN
compilers and many of those compilers are difficult to use with large
codes.  An executable version of FEFF for PCs is available.  It has
been compiled using Watcom's FORTRAN77 compiler which works with a DOS
extender (DOS4GW) to use extended memory.  You will need a PC with
either a 386 and 387 math coprocessor or a 486 with the math
coprocessor embedded in it (SX does not have this, DX does).  You will
also need at least 3 Megabytes of RAM available, IN ADDITION TO whatever
memory is used by DOS and memory-resident utilities.  Please contact us
if you need the PC executable.  Special installation instructions for
the PC version are in the READ.ME file on the PC distribution disk.

   If you prefer your own compiler, or are using an operating system
other than DOS, simply compile the source code using your FORTRAN
compiler and linker as you would for any other machine.

        F. Farges compiled FEFF with absoft's f77 for a NeXT.
        Make sure that the following  options are on:
        f77 -N53 -f -s -O  feff.f
     
        -f makes f77 insensitive to upper and lower cases (triml bwords and  istln)
        -s makes a code for units larger than 512 K
        -N53 uses the 68030/68040 processors with 68881/2 math coproc.

Appendix E- Code Variables Dimensions and Descriptions
******************************************************

   The end of line comments were removed from the code because they are
not standard Fortran.  The array names are a bit cryptic due to the six
character limit in standard FORTRAN - the comments included here
explain what the names mean.  If you need to run larger problems than
the dimension statements in the code allow, simply change the
dimensions in all the relevant parameter statements and recompile.
However, dimensions associated with the atom and phase shift codes,
e.g. the number of r-mesh points and the max number of angular momentum
levels should NOT be changed.

   If you need to modify the code, please contact the authors.  Our
development version with all the comments (and subroutines in
individual files!) is available, although it does use a few features
that are not standard FORTRAN.  We do not guarantee that any new
version will be compatible at the code level with any changes you may
make.

Changes from FEFF 6
===================

   The most significant change is that LDA atomic code was replaced by
Dirac-Fock code. FEFF 7 includes both dipole transitions (l---> l +/-
1).

   The changes have been made for the following cards:
`PRINT'
     FEFF 7.00 will write files phminNN.dat, whenever phaseNN.dat is
     written, which has real part of phase shifts for l=0,1,2. So, they
     have reduced information of corresponding phaseNN.dat, which is
     conveniently arranged in columns for plotting.

`XANES'
     If XANES card is specified, then core hole lifetime is taken into
     account by convolution with Lorentzian in ff2chi. Otherwise, core
     hole life time is included into imaginary part of optical
     potential, as in FEFF 6.10.  Minor differences for chi.dat files
     calculated by two methods in XANES region are expected. The FEFF7
     code includes a fully relativistic calculation of atomic cross
     section.

`EXCHANGE'
     New self energy models are available: a) broadened plasmon model
     (ixc \gt 10) and b) partly nonlocal model (ixc=5) which calculates
     for the photoelectron DF exchange term for core electrons and LDA
     exchange-correlation for valence electrons.  Core-valence
     separation can be easily changed in getorb.f.

     New expert user only cards are introduced:

`MBCONV'
     Makes convolution with model excitation spectrum.

`JUMPRM'
     Removes jumps in potentials at muffin tin radii.

   Also, we made several adjustments to fix some minor problems
reported by FEFF users.


File: feff7.info,  Node: Changes from FEFF 5-04,  Prev: Changes from FEFF 6,  Up: Appendix F-  Changes from previous versions

Changes from FEFF 5-04
======================

   We have made some minor changes to the input files and code.  For
complete descriptions of the new cards and modifications of old ones,
see section III.  With the exception of POLARIZATION and XANES
capabilities, and improved path finder and degeneracy checks, FEFF 6 is
nearly identical to FEFF5.

   Two cards are no longer recognized.  These are:
   *  KLIMIT  (replaced by NEMAX)

   *  REQUIRE

   *  CSIG Code now always uses complex momentum in Debye-Waller factors

   There are several changes and new options.  These are:
`CORRECTIONS'
     Adds real and imaginary part to energy

`CRITERIA'
     The importance criteria are now formulated differently

`NEMAX'
     Max number of energy grid points (replaces KLIMIT)

`PCRITERIA'
     The path finder criteria are now formulated differently

`PRINT'
     Several new options

`POTENTIALS'
     Now has optional labels for unique potentials

   XANES spectra, absolute energies and Atomic Background absorption
can be calculated with the new option
`XANES'
     For now, please, do not use chiNNNN.dat or feffNNNN.dat files for
     EXAFS analysis (such as feffit), when XANES card is used.

   Polarization dependent feff can be calculated with the help of the
following new cards:
`POLARIZATION'
     Specifies polarization vector

`ELLIPTICITY'
     Ellipticity and direction of the incident beam for the elliptical
     polarization.

   FEFF 6.10 adds several new cards, uses a slightly finer k grid
internally, and replaces the feff.dat files with one feff.bin to speed
execution and reduce disk space.

Appendix G- Trouble-shooting FEFF problems
******************************************

   FEFF 7 has been extensively tested but occasionally new bugs show up.
In an effort to maintain trouble-free codes we take all bug reports
seriously.  Often we receive reports by users of older versions of FEFF
of bugs that are fixed in the latest releases. Other code failures can
often be traced to input file errors, sometimes quite subtle.

   An example would be:
   * Non-physical widely spaced distributions of atoms. Symptoms of
     this common problem are very large muffin-tin radii (see the
     header of any .dat file) and possibly a failure of the phase-shift
     program to converge.  This gives error message "hard test fails in
     fovrg".

   *  An error in assigning potential indices; the first atom with a
     given potential index must have the geometry representative of this
     potential type. This is sometimes fixed by using a somewhat larger
     cluster; in fact it is usually desirable to have a larger cluster
     for potential construction than that used in the XAFS calculation
     due to errors in the potentials at surfaces.  Unless the atom
     distribution is physically possible, you can expect the code to
     have problems.

   *  Hash collision in pathfinder. This is rare, but can be corrected
     simply by changing distances in the fourth decimal place.

   *  For the M4 and higher edges you may receive the error message
     like: "Lambda array overfilled". The calculations should be
     repeated with IORDER -70202   card.
