<H2><A NAME="s12">12. Appendix F.   Changes from previous versions</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 Changes from FEFF 6</A></H2>



<P>The most significant change is that LDA atomic code was replaced by
Dirac-Fock code. FEFF 7 includes both dipole transitions (l----&gt; l +/-- 1).</P>
<P>The changes have been made for the following cards:
<DL>
<DT><B> PRINT </B><DD><P>FEFF 7.00 will write files phminNN.dat, whenever phaseNN.dat is written,
which has real part
of phase shifts for l=0,1,2. So, they have reduced information of corresponding
phaseNN.dat, which is conveniently arranged in columns for plotting.</P>

<DT><B> XANES </B><DD><P>If XANES card is specified, then core hole lifetime is taken into account by
convolution with Lorentzian in ff2chi. Otherwise, core hole life time is
included into imaginary part of optical potential, as in FEFF 6.10.
Minor differences for chi.dat files calculated by two methods in XANES
region are expected. The FEFF7 code includes a fully relativistic calculation of
atomic cross section.</P>

<DT><B> EXCHANGE </B><DD><P>New self energy models are available: a) broadened
plasmon model (ixc \gt 10) and b) partly nonlocal model (ixc=5) which
calculates for the photoelectron DF exchange term for core
electrons and LDA exchange-correlation for valence electrons.
Core-valence separation can be easily changed in getorb.f.</P>
<P>New expert user only cards are introduced:</P>
<DT><B> MBCONV </B><DD><P>Makes convolution with model excitation spectrum.</P>
<DT><B> JUMPRM </B><DD><P>Removes jumps in potentials at muffin tin radii.</P>
</DL>
</P>

<P>Also, we made several adjustments to fix some minor problems
reported by FEFF users.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 Changes from FEFF 5.04</A></H2>


<P>We have made some minor changes to the input files
and code.  For complete descriptions of the
new cards and modifications of old ones, see section III.
With the exception of POLARIZATION and XANES capabilities,
and improved path finder and degeneracy checks, FEFF 6 is
nearly identical to FEFF5. </P>
<P>Two cards are no longer recognized.  These are: 
<UL>
<LI> KLIMIT  (replaced by NEMAX) </LI>
<LI> REQUIRE</LI>
<LI> CSIG 
Code now always uses complex momentum in Debye-Waller factors</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>There are several changes and new options.  These are: 
<DL>
<DT><B> CORRECTIONS </B><DD><P>Adds real and imaginary part to energy</P>
<DT><B> CRITERIA </B><DD><P>The importance criteria are now formulated differently</P>
<DT><B> NEMAX </B><DD><P>Max number of energy grid points (replaces KLIMIT)</P>
<DT><B> PCRITERIA </B><DD><P>The path finder criteria are now formulated differently</P>
<DT><B> PRINT </B><DD><P>Several new options</P>
<DT><B> POTENTIALS </B><DD><P>Now has optional labels for unique potentials</P>
</DL>
</P>

<P>XANES spectra, absolute energies and Atomic Background absorption 
can be calculated with the new option 
<DL>
<DT><B> XANES </B><DD><P>For now, please, do not use chiNNNN.dat or feffNNNN.dat files for
EXAFS analysis (such as feffit), when XANES card is used.</P>
</DL>
</P>

<P>Polarization dependent feff can be calculated with the help of the
following new cards: 
<DL>
<DT><B> POLARIZATION </B><DD><P>Specifies polarization vector</P>
<DT><B> ELLIPTICITY </B><DD><P>Ellipticity and direction of the incident beam for the elliptical
polarization. </P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>FEFF 6.10 adds several new cards, uses a slightly finer k grid internally,
and replaces the feff.dat files with one feff.bin to speed execution and
reduce disk space.</P>
