<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC16">Key Sequences, Menus, and Toolbars</A></H2>

<P>
As with most packages in Emacs, there are a number of
different ways of accessing all of the functions in @fuse{}.
The most primitive manner of accessing functions is to type
<KBD>M-x</KBD> followed by the name of the function.  Additionally,
most user functions are bound to key sequences.  Most of these
involve typing <KBD>C-c</KBD> followed by another control character and
then followed by a single character.  These are lengthy key
sequences.  Major modes typically use <KBD>C-c</KBD> sequences.  To
have enough options available, I felt it necessary to have all of
the @fuse{} functions use a second control prefix.

</P>
<P>
<KBD>C-</KBD> means to strike the control key while striking the
following character. <KBD>M-</KBD> means to strike the <KBD>esc</KBD> key
before striking the following key.  Alternatively, you can hold down
the <KBD>alt</KBD> or <KBD>meta</KBD> key while striking the following
key.

</P>
<P>
The list of key sequences is rather lengthy and has been excluded from
this document.  The tutorial, see section `Introduction' in <CITE>The Fuse Tutorial</CITE>, demonstrates the use of many functions.  All of the key
sequences recognized by @fuse{} are listed in the quick reference card.

</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the functions in @fuse{} are bound to either the
<CODE>Input</CODE> menu or to one of the program menus.  Whenever you edit and
input file with @fuse{} there will be a pull down menu labels
<CODE>Input</CODE> and one labelled with the name of the program corresponding
to that input file.

</P>
<P>
@fuse{} makes use of the ability of XEmacs to display a toolbar.  By
default, a toolbar appears at the left side of the screen when a buffer
in input-mode is displayed.  The toolbar has a several of the most
commonly used functions bound to it, including functions for making
templates, running programs, plotting output, and examining log files.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC17">Program Execution</A></H2>

<P>
As discussed in the introduction, one of the fundamental purposed of a
user interface to a set of programs is providing an environment
in which to run the programs.  @fuse{} allows you to run any of the
programs with a key or mouse sequence.  When a program is run, a
second window is opened to display all of the run-time messages
written to standard output and standard error by the program.  This
allows you to follow the progress of the program and to see when the
program has finished.
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>

</P>
<P>
The programs are always invoked using the shell's <SAMP>`time'</SAMP> command.
Upon completion of the program, this causes a summary of the time
consumed by the program to be written to the run-time display window.
Generally this summary is rather cryptic but usually includes the real
time elapsed and the amount of CPU time used.  It would be nice to
parse this string into a more readable form, but unfortunately its
format is different under different shells and operating systems.
Even so, it is sufficiently useful to know this information that I
offer the unparsed string despite its crypticness.

</P>
<P>
The advantages of having the run-time messages written to a buffer in
the manner described above is that it records a running log of work
done during the @fuse{} session.  This log can be saved to a file
using <SAMP>`input-save-run-log'</SAMP> (normally bound to <KBD>C-c C-b l</KBD> and
found in the <SAMP>`Input:miscellaneous'</SAMP> menu).  This runtime log is also
written whenever Emacs is exited so that your last session can be
reviewed.
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>

</P>
<P>
If you are working in a windowing environment, the run-time messages
buffer will be displayed in a separate frame from the frame containing
the input files.  This frame is only about 20 lines tall and lacks much
of the normal decoration of an emacs frame.  The idea is that it is a
display-only frame which takes up only a small amount of screen real
estate.  This frame may be shared with the gnuplot script buffer, but
typically is not.  This is controlled with the variable
<SAMP>`input-use-frames-flag'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC18">Basic run command</A></H3>

<P>
Several functions and features are used by @fuse{} to control program
execution.

</P>

<UL>

<LI>

The function <SAMP>`input-run-any-program-any-file'</SAMP> (normally
bound to <KBD>C-c C-r a</KBD> and found in the <SAMP>`Input'</SAMP> menu) is a general
purpose program execution function.  When you invoke it, you will be
prompted for the name of a program to run and the name of a input file
to use as input to the program.
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>

<LI>

The function <SAMP>`input-run-this-program-this-file'</SAMP> (normally
bound to <KBD>C-c C-r r</KBD> and found in the program menu) is used to run
the program associated with the current file on the current file.
This is the way that programs are most commonly executed in @fuse{}.
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>

<LI>

The function <SAMP>`input-kill-program'</SAMP> (normally bound to <KBD>C-c
C-r k</KBD> and found in both the <SAMP>`Input'</SAMP> and program menus) is used to
kill the currently running process.
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>

<LI>

Only one program can run at a time.  This is, admittedly, a silly
restriction, since Unix certainly does not care how many programs are
running.  The bookkeeping chores involved in running more than one
program at a time are rather complicated.  Perhaps in a future version I
will allow for execution of multiple concurrent programs.  Of course,
you could run the programs from the command line either in a virtual
terminal or in an Emacs shell buffer (<KBD>M-x shell</KBD> or <KBD>C-c s</KBD>).

<LI>

@fuse{} includes a nifty wrapper for program execution which
allows you to name your input files with any name you want and to use
them to run the programs without renaming them to the file name
required by the program.  @fuse{} does this by renaming your input
file to the appropriate name, then renaming it back when the program
is done.  The log file is also renamed to the same name as the input
file, but with <TT>`.log'</TT> substituted for <TT>`.inp'</TT>.  For FEFFIT
the <TT>`prm'</TT> file is also renamed.  For ATOMS, if the input files
called, say, <TT>`cu.inp'</TT>, the FEFF input file generated by the
program will be called <TT>`cu-feff.inp'</TT>.  Care is taken not to
overwrite any existing files.  Suppose a file called <TT>`atoms.inp'</TT>
already exists. Before the <TT>`cu.inp'</TT> is renamed to <TT>`atoms.inp'</TT>
the already existing <TT>`atoms.inp'</TT> will be renamed to a temporary,
randomly generated file name.  Output files are also renamed in this
manner.  Note that the output files of FEFF are not protected
in this manner in the current version of @fuse{}.  Also the output
data files of AUTOBK and FEFFIT are not protected (e.g. the
output background file from AUTOBK will not be protected by this
command wrapper.)
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>

<LI>

In the future it will be nice if @fuse{} is able to parse the
screen output of each of the programs for error messages and to
provide a way of jumping to the place in the input file that cause the
problem.

<LI>

AUTOBK has a feature not shared by the other three
programs.  It is possible to run AUTOBK repeatedly with a single
input file.  Each of the blocks of text controlling a single run of
autobk is called a <EM>stanza</EM>.  AUTOBK minor mode offers a
function for running AUTOBK just on the stanza currently occupied
by the cursor.  The function <SAMP>`autobk-run-stanza'</SAMP> (usually bound to
<KBD>C-c C-r s</KBD> and found in the Autobk menu) does this by copying the
current stanza to a file called <TT>`fuse-stanza.inp'</TT> then running
autobk on that file.  The log file for the single stanza run is thus
called <TT>`fuse-stanza.log'</TT>
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC19">Batch processing</A></H3>

<P>
@fuse{} is able to batch process input files by sequentially running the
appropriate program on any number of input files.  This is accomplished
using a dired buffer.  See the Emacs documentation for details about
dired.

</P>
<P>
To enable @fuse{}'s batch processing capabilities, you must have this
lines somewhere in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file

<PRE>
     (add-hook 'dired-load-hook '(lambda () (load "fuse-dired")))
</PRE>

<P>
Once that is done, any time you are in a dired buffer you will be able
to run any of the programs covered by @fuse{}.  First mark some number of
input files using the <SAMP>`m'</SAMP> command (or any other marking command) in
dired.  Then invoke <SAMP>`fuse-dired-run-marked'</SAMP> by typing <KBD>C-c r</KBD>.
@fuse{} will then load each marked file and run the program appropriate
to that file.  Just sit back and watch.
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>

</P>

<P>
Note that the batch run may require some interactive response in certain
situations.  For example, if @fuse{} cannot figure out the program
associated with the input file (see section <A HREF="fuse_3.html#SEC11">Automatic configuration</A>), @fuse{} will
query you for it.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC20">Plotting</A></H2>



<H3><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC21">Using FUSE's Plotting Utilities</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>

</P>
<P>
@fuse{} plots the output of FEFF and the UWXAFS programs
by parsing for the input file for information about the data that
needs to be plotted and constructing a GNUPLOT script based on
what it finds.  It then pipes the contents of this script to
GNUPLOT.  The scripts can be saved by moving the cursor to the
script buffer and typing <KBD>C-x C-s</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>

</P>
<P>
When one of the plotting options is chosen, a second window or a
separate frame opens up showing the contents of the GNUPLOT script.
Assuming there are no problems, the plot will be displayed and control
of the cursor will return to the window containing the input file.

</P>
<P>
If you are working in a windowing environment, the run-time messages
buffer will be displayed in a separate frame from the frame containing
the input files.  This frame is only about 20 lines tall and lacks much
of the normal decoration of an emacs frame.  I assume that you only
rarely will edit the gnuplot script, so displaying it in a separate and
rather small frame seems preferable.  This frame may shared with the
run-time messages buffer, but typically is not.  This behavior is
controlled by the variable <SAMP>`input-use-frames-flag'</SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>Plotting in ATOMS mode</EM>
<DD>
There is nothing to plot in ATOMS, so there are no plotting functions.
An interface to a ball-and-stick plotter such as RASMOL or
XMOL would sure be nice.

<DT><EM>Plotting in FEFF mode</EM>
<DD>
In FEFF minor mode there are two plotting options.  One is to plot
chi(k) from <TT>`chi.dat'</TT> and the other is to plot mu and mu0 from
<TT>`xmu.dat'</TT>.  The scripts GNUFIX and KW are used.  Both of
these files are written by the fourth module of FEFF.
<TT>`xmu.dat'</TT> is only written if the XANES calculation is enabled by
having the <SAMP>`xanes'</SAMP> keyword in in the input file.
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<A NAME="IDX57"></A>

<DT><EM>Plotting in AUTOBK mode</EM>
<DD>
In AUTOBK minor mode there are four plotting options, (1) plot
chi(k) as specified in the stanza currently occupied by the cursor, (2)
plot the data and AUTOBK's estimation of mu0 from the current
stanza along, (3) plot chi(k) together with the fitting standard from
the current stanza, (4) over-plot all chi(k) functions from all stanzas
in the input file.  The KW script is used to apply <I>k</I>-weight
to the chi(k).

<DT><EM>Plotting in FEFFIT mode</EM>
<DD>
In FEFFIT minor mode there are options to plot fit results in any
of <I>k</I>, <I>R</I>, and back-transformed <I>k</I> spaces.  The data
and the full fit in the chosen space are always plotted.  Plotting in
any of the spaces requires that the appropriate control keyword
(<SAMP>`kspout'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`rspout'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`qspout'</SAMP>) be set to true.

<A NAME="IDX58"></A>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
By default only the data at full fit are shown.  If FEFFIT's
background fitting option is selected by setting <SAMP>`bkgout'</SAMP> to true,
then the background function will be added to the plot.  The individual
paths can also be plotted by marking path paragraphs that you want to
plot.  This is done with the <KBD>C-c C-p m</KBD> command.  When a path is
marked, the <SAMP>`path'</SAMP> keyword will be highlighted and when any of the
three plotting functions is called, the marked paths will be added to
the GNUPLOT script.  Hitting <KBD>C-c C-p m</KBD> again clears the mark.
<KBD>S-mouse-2</KBD> marks and unmarks the paragraph under the mouse
cursor.  <KBD>C-c C-p a</KBD>  marks all paths in the current data set and
<KBD>C-c C-p c</KBD> clears all marks.

<DT><EM>Using GNUPLOT mode</EM>
<DD>
The GNUPLOT script is written in two parts to a buffer which is, by
default, called <TT>`input-mode.gp'</TT>.  The first part initially has no
GNUPLOT commands in it and is never deleted in subsequent plots.
The second part contains all of the commands for the requested plot.
The second part of the script is deleted for each subsequent plot.
These two parts are separated by a line beginning with these characters:
<SAMP>`#-#-#-'</SAMP>.  Any GNUPLOT commands that you wish to issue with
each plot can be typed into the first part of the script.

The automatically generated scripts are always plotted when one of the
plotting options is chosen by key or mouse sequence.  You can interact
with GNUPLOT directly by moving the cursor to the buffer containing
the script.  You can then edit the script as you wish and re-send it to
GNUPLOT.  There are three key sequences for communicating commands
to GNUPLOT.  <SAMP>`send-buffer-to-gnuplot'</SAMP>, bound to <KBD>C-c C-b</KBD>
and in the <SAMP>`gnuplot'</SAMP> menu, sends all commands in the buffer to
GNUPLOT.  <SAMP>`send-region-to-gnuplot'</SAMP>, bound to <KBD>C-c C-r</KBD>
and in the <SAMP>`gnuplot'</SAMP> menu, sends all commands in a selected region
to GNUPLOT.  Finally, <SAMP>`send-line-to-gnuplot'</SAMP>, bound to
<KBD>C-c C-l</KBD> and in the <SAMP>`gnuplot'</SAMP> menu, sends all commands on the
line occupied by the cursor to GNUPLOT.

@fuse{} adds a specialized history list to gnuplot-mode.  Every time and
entire script is sent to GNUPLOT, that script gets pushed onto a
history list.  You can navigate up and down the script history list,
thus revisiting previous plots, by using <KBD>C-c C-p</KBD> and <KBD>C-c C-n</KBD>
in the gnuplot-mode buffer or by hitting the up and down arrow icons in
the XEmacs toolbar.  The depth of the history list is determined by the
value of <CODE>fuse-gnuplot-history</CODE>.
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>

Hitting <KBD>C-c C-f k</KBD> will terminate the GNUPLOT process and
close the frame containing the gnuplot script.
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>

For more details about using gnuplot-mode, see the reference card
<TT>`gpelcard.ps'</TT> which comes with @fuse{}.

<DT><EM>Scripts used in plotting</EM>
<DD>
Several scripts external to Emacs are used in the @fuse{} plotting
utilities, KW, GNUFIX, and MR.  With Unix, GNUPLOT
is able to pipe data through external scripts using the system
<SAMP>`popen'</SAMP> function.  This is the purpose of the <SAMP>`&#60;'</SAMP> character
that appears in several of @fuse{}'s plotting scripts.
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>

KW is a simple AWK script for k-weighting chi(k) data.  It
simply multiplies each y-value in the data file by some power of the
x-value.  GNUFIX is a Bourne shell script containing a single
SED command.  It prepends a comment character (<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>) to each
line in the header of <TT>`chi.dat'</TT> or <TT>`xmu.dat'</TT> so that these
files may be properly plotted using GNUPLOT.  MR is a Bourne
shell script used as an interface to a Fortran program for reading a
record from a UWXAFS binary file.

Another script, ESHIFT, comes with @fuse{} although it is not
used in any of the built-in script generating functions.  The purpose
of this script is to e0-shift mu(E) data.  In GNUPLOT it
works in a manner analogous to KW.  The following GNUPLOT
command plots some data with a 5 volt e0 shift:

<PRE>
	pl '&#60;eshift esh=5 data.xmu'
</PRE>

Note that any of these scripts can be used at the command line by
redirecting their output to a file.  For example:

<PRE>
	# kw w=5 data.chi &#62; data.chi.weighted
	# gnufix esh=5 xmu.dat &#62; xmu.data.fixed
	# eshift esh=5 data.xmu &#62; data.xmu.shifted
	# mr data.xmu, 1 &#62; data.xmu.ascii
</PRE>

These scripts are all in the <TT>`scripts'</TT> directory in the
distribution.  The directory containing these scripts is the value of
<CODE>fuse-bin-location</CODE>.  This directory is added to the
<CODE>exec-path</CODE> when @fuse{} is started.

<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC22">Limitations to FUSE's Plotting Utilities</A></H3>

<P>
@fuse{} is supposed to have a mechanism for detecting problems with the
commands sent to GNUPLOT.  In truth, I never got this to work
properly and found that it was not entirely necessary.  If something
goes wrong with the plot, look at the <SAMP>`gnuplot-program'</SAMP> buffer by
simply switching to that buffer or by using the
<SAMP>`gnuplot-jump-to-gnuplot-buffer'</SAMP> function, normally bound to
<KBD>C-c C-e</KBD> and in the <SAMP>`Gnuplot'</SAMP> menu in the gnuplot-buffer.
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>

</P>
<P>
@fuse{}'s plotting functions are able to interact with either ASCII
data or data in the UWXAFS binary format.  Because of certain
features of the UWXAFS binary format, the GNUPLOT scripts
generated by @fuse{} may not be what you want.  For example, a
script for a FEFFIT fit is written assuming that the output data
was written to a new file rather than appended to a pre-existing
file.  Thus the fit script uses numeric keys (<SAMP>`nkeys'</SAMP>) beginning
with 1.

</P>
<P>
Interaction with the UWXAFS binary files is one of the weaker areas
in @fuse{}.  In truth, I rarely use the binary files and my memory of
how the programs read and write them is a bit fuzzy.  In particular, I
don't recall how AUTOBK writes its many possible output files when
binary output is used.  I have a few ideas about how to improve plotting
from the binary files.  It could be possible to set an nkey offset
variable to handle pre-existing files.  Another possibility would be
something like Dired mode in Emacs, where the contents of the binary
file are displayed to a buffer and records could be marked and
subsequently plotted.
