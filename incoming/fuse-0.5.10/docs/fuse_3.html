<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC6">The syntax and appearance of input files</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC7">The syntax of FEFF and the UWXAFS programs</A></H2>

<P>
Each of FEFF and the UWXAFS programs requires an input file
as part of its input structure.  This input file is always an ASCII
text file which contains all of the information required by the
program at run-time.  This information might include the names and
locations of any other input files, the names to be assigned to output
files, and any physical or run-time parameters required by the
program.

</P>
<P>
Although there are some differences in how each program interprets its
input file, there are several common rules governing the syntactic
structure of the input files.  The input files are always parsed.
This means that there is considerable freedom in the order in which
information is placed in the input file.  Each program reads a line of
input and searches for specially recognized words called
<EM>keywords</EM>.  When a recognized keyword is found, the next one or
more words in the input file are read and interpreted in a context
appropriate to the keyword.  For example, in AUTOBK the word
<SAMP>`data'</SAMP> is used to specify the name of the file containing the input
chi(k) data.  When AUTOBK encounters the word <SAMP>`data'</SAMP> it
interprets the following word as the name of a computer file.
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>

</P>
<P>
In all of the programs keywords and their values are separated by
white space.  The formal definition of white space in all of the
programs is any number of space or tab characters followed by zero or
one comma or equals sign followed by any number of spaces or
tabs.<A NAME="DOCF4" HREF="fuse_foot.html#FOOT4">(4)</A>
Here is an example of how this rule might be implemented:

<PRE>
	keyword1 = value1	keyword2 = value2
</PRE>

<P>
In this example, the equals sign (<SAMP>`='</SAMP>) is used to emphasize the
relationship between the keyword and its value, and a tab is inserted
before the second keyword.
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>

</P>
<P>
In most cases there can be any number of keyword/value pairs on a line
and the keywords can come in any order.  There are a few notable
exceptions to this rule:

</P>

<OL>

<LI>

In FEFF there can only be one keyword per line and it must
come at the beginning of the line.  Anything on a line after the
keyword and its value is ignored by FEFF.

<LI>

In ATOMS the keyword <SAMP>`atoms'</SAMP> (or possibly <SAMP>`basis'</SAMP>)
must be the last keyword in the file.

<LI>

In ATOMS the 10 characters following the keyword
<SAMP>`space'</SAMP> are read as the value of that keyword.  This is because
space group notation contains spaces, but no space group symbol is
longer than 10 characters.

<LI>

In FEFFIT all path parameters and the words <SAMP>`set'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`guess'</SAMP>, and <SAMP>`local'</SAMP> must be the only keywords on their lines
and must come at the beginning of the line.

<LI>

In FEFFIT there is one keyword that contains white space.
It is <SAMP>`next data set'</SAMP> and is used to denote the boundary between
data sets.

</OL>

<P>
For complete details on the keywords recognized by these programs and
the syntax of their values, see the documents for each program.

</P>
<P>
Each of the programs recognizes certain characters as comment
characters.  This means that any text on a line following one of these
characters will be ignored by the program.  In FEFF <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> is the
comment character.  In ATOMS and AUTOBK any of <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`#'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> are comment characters.  In FEFFIT
all of <SAMP>`*'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> are beginning of line
comment characters, while <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, or <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> are comment
characters in the middle of the line.  The reason for this distinction
in FEFFIT is that <SAMP>`*'</SAMP> is used in math expressions.

<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC8">Additional syntax rules imposed by FUSE</A></H2>

<P>
The syntax rules described above are an integral part of @fuse{} and
are used to determine the behavior of most of its features.  There is
a major syntactic rule imposed by @fuse{} for FEFFIT input that
is not a requirement of the program.  This rule is:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
All path parameters sharing a common path index (i.e. all those
referring to the same scattering path as calculated by FEFF) must
be contiguous in the input file.  Such a grouping of path parameters is
called a <EM>path paragraph</EM>.  The first line in a path paragraph
<STRONG>must</STRONG> be for the path parameter <SAMP>`path'</SAMP>, which is used to
identify the name of the FEFF output file containing the
calculation for that scattering path.  Path paragraphs are separated by
lines containing only comment and whitespace characters (i.e. space,
tab, comma, <KBD>=</KBD>, <KBD>*</KBD>, <KBD>#</KBD>, <KBD>%</KBD>, and <KBD>!</KBD>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>

</P>
<P>
This definition of the path paragraph is <STRONG>required</STRONG> for several
of the most powerful editing features in FEFFIT minor mode.  I
strongly encourage you to observe the syntactic structure of the path
paragraph.  If you prefer to group together all <SAMP>`path'</SAMP> lines
separately from all <SAMP>`sigma2'</SAMP> lines, then you will not find
FEFFIT minor mode to be particularly helpful.  Sorry.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC9">Syntax colorization</A></H2>

<P>
Each minor mode has rules for syntax colorization of the text.
@fuse{} supports both font-lock and hilit19 for syntax colorization.  Keywords
are cast in one of several colors, with conceptually similar keywords
sharing colors.  Comments are set in a different color, which is red by
default.  See the installation instructions for how to enable your Emacs
session to use @fuse{}'s syntax colorization.

</P>
<P>
If you already use either <EM>font-lock</EM> or <EM>hilit19</EM>, then
@fuse{} will display your input files with syntax colorization.  If you
would like to start using syntax colorization, the set up is easy.  To
enable syntax coloring of the text of your input files using font-lock,
place the following line in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file:

<PRE>
     (global-font-lock-mode t)
</PRE>

<P>
To enable syntax coloring of the text of your input files using the
hilit19 package, place the following lines in your <TT>`.emacs'</TT> file:

<PRE>
     (cond (window-system
            (setq hilit-mode-enable-list  '(not text-mode)
                   hilit-background-mode   'light
                   hilit-inhibit-hooks     nil
                   hilit-inhibit-rebinding nil)
            (require 'hilit19) ))
</PRE>

<P>
I find that font-lock offers better performance than
<TT>`hilit19'</TT>.  Both packages are supported by @fuse{}, although
hilit19 is no longer supported by its author.

<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC10">Associating programs with input files</A></H2>

<P>
Each of the programs requires that the input file have a particular
name.  For example FEFF requires that its input file be called
<TT>`feff.inp'</TT>.  You might, however, wish to use file names which are
mnemonically associated with the contents of the file.  For instance,
the <TT>`feff.inp'</TT> file used to model data on metallic copper might be
called <TT>`cu-feff.inp'</TT>.  Because @fuse{} uses minor modes specific to
each program for editing the input files, it is necessary for @fuse{} to
determine which for which program each edited input file is intended.
To determine this, it first looks at the file name, if the filename is
obviously indicative of a particular program (e.g. <TT>`autobk.inp'</TT> is
almost certainly intended for use with AUTOBK) then that program is
used.  If the filename is not obviously indicative, then @fuse{} may
prompt you for a program name when you edit the file for the first time.
It is important to answer this question correctly.  Every input file is
edited in INPUT major mode and in a minor mode appropriate to the
program.  To enable the full functionality of @fuse{}, the associated
program must be identified so that the appropriate minor mode can be
used.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC11">Automatic configuration</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are several features in @fuse{} that are routinely set in the
course of editing an input files that are convenient to retain between
editing sessions.  To do this, @fuse{} writes special comment lines
to your input files that are read when the file is initially loaded by
Emacs and used to set variables which appropriately alter the behavior
of @fuse{}.  The comment lines are generally written to the end of
the input file and begin with a special string of comment characters.
They look something like this:

<PRE>
!!&#38;&#38; Local Variables:
!!&#38;&#38; input-program-name: "autobk"
!!&#38;&#38; End:
</PRE>

<P>
There are several variables which are set in this manner.  The most
important is the one that identifies the program for which the input
file is intended.  In the example above, the comment line identifies
AUTOBK as the program for the input file.

</P>
<P>
There are currently five other pieces of information that are stored
in these special comment lines.  These are (1) the directory path to
the location of files from a FEFF run, (2) the directory path to
input data files, (3) the directory path to out files, (4) the default
k-weight to use when chi(k) data is plotted, and (5) the name of
the master file for an include file in a multi-file input file.  In
the future more automatic configuration possibilities may be added.
@fuse{} will ignore any other variable values in the list when it
updates it's own automatically configured variables.

</P>
<P>
The automatic configuration lines are updated each time an input file is
saved to disk.  Each of the variable set by these lines can be altered
by functions built into @fuse{} during the course of editing.  These are
found in the <SAMP>`Input'</SAMP> menu and described in the quick reference
card.  One of the variables in @fuse{},
<SAMP>`input-prohibit-autoconfig-flag'</SAMP>, can be set to prohibit the
writing of the auto-configuration lines.  Use this if you object to
having @fuse{} insert text into your input file.  I recommend, though,
that you allow it to do so.  It is very convenient to not have to
re-enter this information every time the file is edited.

<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC12">Keywords and keyword parsing</A></H2>

<P>
One of the difficulties of using FEFF and the UWXAFS
programs is remembering the names of the keywords recognized by the
various programs and what values each of the keywords takes.
@fuse{} can help you.  It has knowledge of all keywords used by each
of the programs hardwired in and offers several functions to let you
use that knowledge.
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>Templates</STRONG>
<DD>
Each minor mode offers template functions which insert necessary
keywords into your input file with blank spaces for you to fill in
appropriate values.  Using the templates assures that your input file
will at least run the program to completion without neglecting any
crucial information.  The templates are described in more details in
the chapters on the minor modes.

All of the templates in @fuse{} are made using the <SAMP>`tempo'</SAMP> package.
This means that each place where a value needs to be inserted by the
user is a <EM>hotspot</EM>.  The hotspots are marked by salmon colored
rectangles.  Once the hotspots are filled in you can clear the salmon
colored rectangles with <KBD>C-c C-t c</KBD>.  The functions
<SAMP>`tempo-forward-mark'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`tempo-backward-mark'</SAMP>, bound in
@fuse{} to <KBD>M-n</KBD> and <KBD>M-p</KBD>, can be used to move among the
hotspots.

<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>

<DT><STRONG>Keyword completion</STRONG>
<DD>
The function <SAMP>`input-complete-keyword'</SAMP> (normally bound to
<KBD>M-<KBD>tab</KBD></KBD>) will attempt to complete a partially typed
keyword.  If the string already typed matches only one possible
keyword, that keyword will be completed, colored according to syntax,
and a brief explanation of the keyword will be offered in the echo
area.  If the typed string does not match any keyword, you will be
told in the echo area.  If more than one keyword is matched, all
possible matches will be offered in the echo area.  As an example,
when editing a FEFFIT input file, if you type <KBD>g</KBD> then
<KBD>M-<KBD>tab</KBD></KBD>, <SAMP>`guess'</SAMP> will be inserted into your input file
and you will told in the echo area that <SAMP>`guess'</SAMP> is used to set the
name and initial value of a fitting parameter.

<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>

<DT><STRONG>Argument descriptions</STRONG>
<DD>
The function <SAMP>`input-arg-for-this-keyword'</SAMP> (normally bound to
<KBD>M-?</KBD>) will offer a brief description of the keyword underneath the
cursor along with a description of the sort of argument it takes.  The
is written to the echo area.
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>

<DT><STRONG>Verification of keyword values</STRONG>
<DD>
The function <SAMP>`input-check-this-keyword-arg'</SAMP> (normally bound to
<KBD>M-<KBD>ret</KBD></KBD>) will perform a simple check of the value of the
keyword underneath the cursor.  For example, if the keyword is
supposed to take a numeric value, this function will check to see that
the value is a number.  If the keyword specifies an input data file,
it will check to see that the value is the name of a readable file.
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>

<DT><STRONG>Verification of input files</STRONG>
<DD>
<EM>This functionality is not yet a part of</EM> @fuse{}, @emph{but in a
future version a function will exist to verify an entire input file by
repeatedly using <BR><SAMP>`input-check-this-keyword-arg'</SAMP>.  If any mistakes
are found, error messages will be written to a second window.  I plan
to provide a simple way of jumping from messages in the error window
to the appropriate point in the input file.}

<DT><STRONG>Display of all possible keywords</STRONG>
<DD>
The function <SAMP>`input-display-keywords'</SAMP> (normally bound to <KBD>C-c
C-b k</KBD>) opens a second window and displays all possible keywords for the
program associated with the input file.  The keywords are tabulated
along with brief descriptions.

<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC13">Indentation and separation</A></H2>

<P>
In the first section of this chapter I described the rules recognized
by the programs for separating keywords and values.  As long as at
least one whitespace character separates words in the input files, the
programs are quite content.  Merely meeting the minimum requirement,
however, will make for a messy looking and hard to read input file.
Because you or some other human will eventually read your input file,
it is convenient to adopt certain conventions about indenting text and
about separating textual elements within the input files.
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>

</P>
<P>
To make input files easier to read thus easier to understand, @fuse{}
uses several configurable rules for determining proper indentation and
separation.  The choices @fuse{} makes about indentation and separation
are context-dependent.  That is, the indentation of, say, a line
containing a <SAMP>`guess'</SAMP>ed variable in FEFFIT may be different
from the indentation of a line in an AUTOBK input file.  Variables
in @fuse{} with names ending in either <SAMP>`indent'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`separate'</SAMP>
control the amount and type of whitespace used in various situation by
many @fuse{} functions.

</P>
<P>
Each of these variables takes an integer value.  A positive integer
specific how many <EM>spaces</EM> will be inserted as indentation or
separation.  A negative number specifies the number of <EM>tabs</EM> to
insert.  For indentation variables, a value of 0 means that no
whitespace will be inserted, i.e. the text will be flush against the
left side of the screen.  For separation variables, a value of 0 will
default to -1, i.e. a single tab character.  While you are certainly
free to choose absurdly large numbers, for example -73 for an
indentation value, I strongly recommend against this.  For one thing,
an indentation of 73 tabs will be ugly and difficult to read.  For
another, each of the programs has a hard-wired limit on the length of
a text line.  For example, ATOMS only reads the first 78
characters of each line.

</P>
<P>
Each minor mode has a <SAMP>`cleaning'</SAMP> function which can be used to
standardize the appearance of the file.  Each cleaning function will
alter each line in the file by deleting all existing indentation and
separation on the line and inserting the appropriate whitespace as
determined from the user configuration variables.  All of the variables
have defaults that will make any input file tidy and easy to read.  The
default values for variables used by the FEFF minor mode are chosen
to make the file look like one generated by ATOMS.
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>

</P>
<P>
Several other functions, such as those that insert templates, also use
the indentation and separation variables.
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="fuse_toc.html#TOC14">Master files and include files</A></H2>

<P>
FEFFIT, AUTOBK, and PHIT allow the use of include files.
@fuse{} allows you to specify the relationship between include files and
their master files by setting an automatic configuration variable.
Currently this variable is used only by a few functions.  The program
running function will use the master file as the input file.  Also the
functions for jumping to log and prm files jump to the files appropriate
to the master file.  Plotting and paragraph manipulation functions do
not currently use the master file.
