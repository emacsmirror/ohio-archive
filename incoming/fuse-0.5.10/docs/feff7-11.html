<P>The end of line comments were removed from the code because they are not 
standard Fortran.  The array names are a bit cryptic due to the six character 
limit in standard FORTRAN -- the comments included here explain what the names 
mean.  If you need to run larger problems than the dimension statements in the 
code allow, simply change the dimensions in all the relevant parameter 
statements and recompile.  However, dimensions associated with the atom and 
phase shift codes, e.g. the number of r-mesh points and the max number of 
angular momentum levels should NOT be changed. </P>
<P>If you need to modify the code, please contact the authors.  Our development
version with all the comments (and subroutines in individual files!) is
available, although it does use a few features that are not standard FORTRAN.
We do not guarantee that any new version will be compatible at the code
level with any changes you may make.</P>
