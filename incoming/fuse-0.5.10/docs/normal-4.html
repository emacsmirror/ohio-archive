<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Source Code Parameters</A></H2>


<P>Normal is shipped with the following hard-wired parameters:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      parameter (nptx=2**11, nfilx=50, ndocx=25)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

These parameters are defined as follows: </P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B> <CODE>nptx</CODE> </B><DD><P>max number of input or output data points</P>
<DT><B> <CODE>nrangx</CODE> </B><DD><P>max number of data sets to process</P>
<DT><B> <CODE>ndocx</CODE> </B><DD><P>max number of documents in i/o data</P>
</DL>
 </P>
<P>If any of these are too small, they can be changed in the source code
and the source code can be recompiled. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Code Portability and Code Compilation</A></H2>


<P>The 1977 ANSI Standard for Fortran has been followed closely, so that
feffit should easily compile on any machine and run without any
problems.  The only significant departures from Fortran 77 are the
assumption of the ASCII character set and the use of
<CODE>integer*2</CODE> variables for the UWXAFS binary file handling
routines.  A non standard trick is occasionally used in manipulating
character strings, but the author has never seen this fail on any
machine in his experience. </P>
<P>There are, unfortunately, aspects of Fortran which are machine- and
compiler-dependent by design.  One such aspect occurs in <SF>Normal</SF>
in the form of a compiler-dependent dimension for the "word-length" of
the data in the UWXAFS binary files.  The code cannot easily be made
truly standard without significant changes to the UWXAFS binary file
handling routines.  The distributed code will, however, work on most
machines, with the notable exception of a Vax.  Changing the first
executable statement of <SF>Normal</SF> from <CODE>lvax = .false.</CODE>
to <CODE>lvax = .true.</CODE> will make the code work on a Vax. </P>
<P>The UWXAFS binary file handling routines also use character strings
which are 2048 characters long.  Though standard, some compilers need
to be told to accept character strings this long.  The notable example
of such a compiler is xlf (for AIX, IBM's Unix flavor), which needs
the compiler switch "-qcharlen=2048".  While compiling on any
machine, we recommend including some form of array bounds checking.
And if you have any problems with the compilation, it may be
worthwhile to turn off compiler optimization flags.  There may be some
persistent, benign compiler warnings when you compile feffit.  There
may also be "comparison is always false" warnings when using f2c.
These can both be safely ignored. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 Adding More Data Formats to Normal</A></H2>


<P>If the two data file formats (UWXAFS, ASCII) are not acceptable or
convenient to your needs (that is, if you prefer using some other
format), other choices could be added with a minimal amount of coding.
The input and output of data files is fairly well-isolated, with
subroutine <CODE>inpdat</CODE> and <CODE>outdat</CODE> controlling
which data format to use.  If you'd like another file format either
contact us about it or follow the example of the routines
<CODE>inpcol</CODE> and <CODE>outcol</CODE>, which read and write
files in the ASCII column data format. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 About this document.</A></H2>

<P>This document was composed using a mark-up language called
<CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE>.  This is the documentation standard of the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu//pub/linux/docs/linux-doc-project/LDP-Manifesto">Linux Documentation Project</A>.  <CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE> is an
adaptation of the QWERTZ document type definition written by Tom
Gordon.  <CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE> is available on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu//pub/linux/utils/text/linuxdoc-sgml-1.2.tar.gz">the net</A>.</P>
<P>The value of a Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is that it
can be processed into any number of formats from a common source.
Using <CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE>, a single marked up file can be used to produce
LaTeX, PostScript, plain ASCII, HTML, TeXinfo, or dvi
documentation.</P>
