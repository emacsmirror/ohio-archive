<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Writing Sensible Input Files</A></H2>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Specifying Keywords</A></H2>

<P><SF>Phit</SF> reads the input file by reading in a single line
at a time and parsing the words on that line.  Words in the line are
separated by white space, where the white space can be zero or one comma
or equals sign along with any number of spaces and tabs.  Each word
is compared to a list of recognized keywords.  If it is found, the
appropriate number of words following the recognized keyword are
interpreted as the values associated with that keyword.  For
instance, if the following words are found in a line:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        xaxis  =  e
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

the word <CODE>xaxis</CODE> will be recognized as a keyword and the word
<CODE>e</CODE> will be interpreted as the character string labeling the
xaxis.  If this is found:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        sigdat     =3.0956
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

then <CODE>sigdat</CODE> will be recognized as a keyword and the character string
<CODE>3.0956</CODE> will be internally read as a floating point number.
In this case:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        function        1       m*x + b
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<CODE>function</CODE> will be recognized, <CODE>1</CODE> will be
read as an integer, and the remainder of the line will be recognized
as the math expression associated with function #1. </P>
<P>This parsing scheme allows the input file to read more like common
English and is intended to facilitate use of a rather complicated
program.  The parsing scheme is insensitive to case, so <CODE>GUESS</CODE>
is equivalent to <CODE>guess</CODE>, <CODE>Guess</CODE>, and <CODE>gUEsS</CODE>.
Blank lines and lines beginning with the comment characters <CODE>!</CODE>,
<CODE>%</CODE>, or <CODE>#</CODE> will be ignored, as will <CODE>id</CODE> lines
that correspond to no function and <CODE>title</CODE> lines in excess of
9.  Recall that the white space between words can be any number of
tabs or blanks and no more than one comma or equals sign. </P>
<P>There is little established order in which the keywords must be found
in the input file.  The only structure imposed on the input file is
that everything on a line after the keyword <CODE>title</CODE> will be
included in the title and that the keywords <CODE>guess</CODE>,
<CODE>set</CODE>, <CODE>function</CODE>, and <CODE>id</CODE> must be on
their own lines. </P>




<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Guess and Set Values</A></H2>

<P>The guess values are the parameters that will actually be varied to
produce the best fit.  The labels for the guess values are used to
identify these parameters in the set value and function math
expressions.  The initial guess must be a number.  It cannot be a math
expression.   </P>
<P>All guess values must be used in math expression.  Any unused guess
value will cause an error message to be written to the screen and the
program to stop.  The minimization algorithm is ill-posed if a
variable has no effect on the function being minimized.  There is
still a pitfall of unused guess values.  If the guess value is used
to evaluate a set value and the set value is not used in any function,
then the minimization will be ill-posed. </P>
<P>The set values are stated in the input file as math expressions, where
the math expression can be simply a number or some valid combination
of numbers, special functions, other set and guess values, and
operators.  If a set value is unused in other math expressions, a
warning will be written to the screen, but the program will continue.
Set values can depend on other set values, but they cannot be
self-referencing.  That is, a set value may not depend on itself, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        a = a+1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If a self-referencing set value is found, an error message will be
written to the screen and the program will stop. </P>




<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Writing Math Expressions</A></H2>

<P>The algorithm for encoding the math expressions found in the input
file follows the Fortran standard for operator precedence.  Quantities
in parentheses and special functions will be evaluated first, followed
in order by exponentiation, multiplication/division, and
addition/subtraction. </P>
<P>Blanks and tabs are removed from math expressions before encoding.
Using blanks to make math expressions more easily understood to the
human reader of the input file in encouraged. </P>
<P>The arguments to special functions must be enclosed in parentheses and
must be separated by commas.  Functions of a single argument need no
commas.  Functions of more than one argument make no assumptions about
the value of the arguments, so all arguments must be specified. </P>
<P>There is a known bug in the encoding algorithm.  If a function of more
than one argument is passed as the argument of a function of more than
one argument, there will be an error counting the commas.  The
following will trip this bug:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        set     a       gauss( e,  min(1, center), width)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This would constrain the center point of the Gaussian to be no larger
than 1.  If this is what you want, you should do this instead:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        set     b       min(1,center)
        set     a       gauss( e, b, width)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Because all math expressions must be contained on a single line,
writing math expressions in terms of set values is often necessary.</P>

<P>The great value of this scheme of guess values and math expressions is
that arbitrarily robust and complex fitting models can be introduced.
For example, more than one function can depend on one variable
parameter.  Thus the set of variables can be small and robust.  The
set of functions actually summed and used in the fit is easily created
and changed by the user, allowing many different fitting models to be
tested.  </P>
<P>If any mistakes are found in any math expression, a warning message
containing the nature of the problem will be written to the screen and
the program will stop. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Choosing Variable Labels</A></H2>

<P>The labels associated with the set and guess values and with the
xaxis are completely arbitrary and subject to the preferences of the
user.  Choosing variable names that are mnemonic is a good idea.  If
the data that you are fitting is measured in energy, then <CODE>e</CODE>
might be chosen as the xaxis label for use in the math expressions.
The variable associated with the width of a Lorentzian function might
be <CODE>width</CODE>.  It might also be called <CODE>chthon</CODE> or
anything else that has meaning to you. </P>
<P>The labels for the set and guess values and the xaxis must be less
than 20 characters.  They must be composed of keyboard characters that
are unambiguous in the context of math expressions.  This means that
<CODE>+</CODE>, <CODE>-</CODE>, <CODE>*</CODE>, <CODE>/</CODE>, <CODE>&circ;</CODE>,
<CODE>(</CODE>, and <CODE>)</CODE> cannot be part of a label.  For example,
the expression <CODE>h-bar</CODE> will be interpreted as the value of
<CODE>bar</CODE> subtracted from the value of <CODE>h</CODE>.  The names of
functions understood by <SF>Phit</SF> can, in fact, be variable names.
<SF>Phit</SF> recognizes function names as functions when followed
immediately by an open parenthesis (<CODE>(</CODE>).  This math
expression:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        sinh * sinh(3)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

will thus be interpreted as the variable <CODE>sinh</CODE> multiplied by
the hyperbolic sine of 3. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Functions Other Than Those Found in Phit</A></H2>


<P>If you need a function that is not recognized by the math expression
encoder, there is a solution that does not involve modifying the
Fortran source code.  If your function is representable in a
reasonable number of terms, then the new function can be expressed as
a sum of set values in the input file.  Here, for instance, is the
math expression for a fifth order Legendre polynomial as a function of
the xaxis label <CODE>x</CODE>:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        set     leg5    (63*x**5 + 70*x**3 + 15*x) / 8
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You could define some number of Legendre polynomials in this fashion
and fit data as a weighted expansion in Legendre polynomials.  If your
function is described by a series expansion that is convergent in a
small number of terms, this technique of using set values will work
well. </P>
<P>A function commonly used to analyze XANES is the pseudo-Voight
function.  This is a linear combination of a Lorentzian and a
Gaussian.  This could be constructed as follows: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
        guess   x0        0             ! center of function
        guess   g_width   1             ! gaussian width
        guess   l_width   1             ! lorentzian width
        guess   nu        0.5           ! relative weight lineshapes
        set     g         gauss(x, x0, g_width)
        set     l         lor(x, x0, l_width)
        set     voight    nu * g + (1-nu) * l
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

In this example, a pseudo-Voight is constructed and four variables
describing the function are allowed to float.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Using Phit without Fitting</A></H2>

<P>Occasionally <SF>Phit</SF> is run without performing a fit.  One might
use <SF>Phit</SF> to construct some complicated line shape or to
evaluate a fitting function at its initial guess values.  There are
three ways make <SF>Phit</SF> run to completion without performing a
fit:
<OL>
<LI> Use the <CODE>nofit</CODE> keyword.</LI>
<LI> Specify no guess values.</LI>
<LI> Specify no input data set.</LI>
</OL>
 </P>
<P>If the <CODE>nofit</CODE> keyword is specified then the set and function
math expressions will be evaluated using the initial values of the
guess parameters.  The sum of functions and, if requested, the
individual functions will be written to disk.  The functions will be
evaluated on the x-axis grid of the input data file. </P>
<P>If no guess parameters are specifies, then the functions will be
evaluated using the set values on the data grid of the input data
file.  </P>
<P>If no input data is specified, the sets and functions will be
evaluated using the initial values for any guess functions.  The
functions will be evaluated on an evenly spaced data grid determined
by the values of the keywords <CODE>xmin</CODE>, <CODE>xmax</CODE>, and
<CODE>npoints</CODE>. </P>
