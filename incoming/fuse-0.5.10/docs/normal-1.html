<P><SF>Normal</SF> takes multiple, raw xmu data sets as its input and returns
them with a pre-edge line subtracted, normalized to the value of the
edge step, and aligned in energy.  <SF>NOrmal</SF> can also calculate
numerical derivatives of the normalized data.  <SF>Normal</SF> requires an
input file which is a simple text file containing instructions for the
normalization and alignment.  It also requires data in either the
UWXAFS binary or ASCII format.  It will write the output data to
either file format.</P>
<P>The pre-edge subtraction of each of the input data sets is performed
in the standard fashion for XAFS data.  A line is chosen by regression
from data before the absorption edge.  This line is subtracted from
the entire data range, leaving data that is zero-valued before the
edge. </P>
<P>Alignment in energy requires that one data set be chosen as the
standard and that all other data sets be shifted in energy to best
match that standard.  The standard is normalized to the height of the
edge step.  The edge step is found by regressing a line to the data in
some energy range after the edge.  This line is extrapolated back to
the edge energy and the value of the intercept at the edge energy is
used as the edge step.  The data is divided at all points by this
number.  Thus the data starts at zero and rises values near one.  The
normalization for all other data sets is chosen as part of the
alignment algorithm. </P>
<P>A Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squares minimization is used to
align each individual data set to the standard.  Three variables are
used to minimize the difference between the data set and the standard.
These variables are an energy shift, an edge step, and the slope of a
line added to the region after the edge.  The best-fit value for the
energy shift is added to the output data so that the standard and all
other files lie on grids referenced to the same energy origin.  Each
data set is normalized to the best fit value of the edge step.  A line
which is zero at the edge energy is subtracted from the data set in
the region after the edge to compensate for any differences in, say,
the detector responses in the data and the standard.  The slope of
this subtracted line is the third fitting variable. </P>
<P>The results of the alignment fit are written to the header of the
output file.  (See 
<A HREF="normal-2.html#header">below</A> for a description of
the file formats.)  The original data can be reconstructed from the
normalized and aligned data using the fit results.   The energy scale
is shifted by subtracting the best-fit e0 shift, then the xmu data is
modified by this formula: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
xmu(normalized) = xmu(original) / step + [theta(e-e0)*slope*(e-e0)]
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
Here theta indicates a step function, theta(e-e0)=0 when e&gt;e0 and
theta(e-e0)=1 when e&lt;e0.  The e0 value is relative to the shifted
energy scale. </P>
<P>The numerical derivative is performed by Ridder's method of polynomial
extraction.  This is somewhat slower than an n-point difference, but
much less prone to error.</P>
