<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Output files</A></H2>




<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 phase.bin</A></H2>

<P>This is a binary file with the scattering phase shifts for each unique
potential.  It is used by GENFMT and the pathfinder. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 paths.dat</A></H2>

<P>Written by the pathfinder, this is a description of all the paths that
fit the criteria used by the pathfinder.  It is used by GENFMT. The
path descriptions include cartesian coordinates of atoms in the path,
scattering angles, leg lengths and degeneracy. For details on editing
this by hand, see section 4. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 crit.dat</A></H2>

<P>Values of the quantities tested against the various criteria in the
pathfinder. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.4">6.4 geom.dat</A></H2>

<P>Written by feff for use with the pathfinder, and deleted after use.  It
is an atom list created from the user-input list in feff.inp.  For more
information, see the NOGEOM card in section 4. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.5">6.5 list.dat</A></H2>

<P>List of files to use to create chi.dat.  Written by GENFMT when the
xafs parameters are calculated and used by FF2CHI.  This contains the
curved wave importance ratios, which you may wish to study. For details
on editing this by hand, see section 5. </P>
<P>The curved wave importance ratios are the importance of a particular
path relative to the most important path encountered so far in the
calculation.  If the first path is the most important in the problem,
all the importance factors will be expressed as a fraction of that path.
However, if the third path considered is the most important, and the first
path is the next most important, path 1 will have a factor of 100%, path 2
will be a fraction of the first path's importance, path 3 will have an
importance of 100% (since it is now the most important path), and subsequent
paths will be expressed as a percent of path 3's importance.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.6">6.6 chi.dat</A></H2>

<P>Standard xafs data k, chi(k), |chi(k)| relative to threshold (k=0): The
header also contains enough information to specify what model was used
to create this file. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.7">6.7 feff.bin</A></H2>

<P>A binary file that contains all the information about the XAFS from all
of the paths.  This replaces the old feffNNNN.dat files (which you can
make using the PRINT card).  If you want to use this file with your own
analysis package, use the code in subroutine feffdt
as an example of how to read it.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.8">6.8 feffNNNN.dat</A></H2>

<P>You have to use PRINT option to obtain these files.
Effective scattering amplitude and phase shift data, with   k
referenced to threshold for shell nn: k,  phi_c, |feff|,
ph(feff),
redfac, lambda,  Re(p)</P>
<P>If you need these, use PRINT option for ff2chi greater than 3,
which will read
feff.bin and write the feffNNNN.dat files in exactly the form you're
used to.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss6.9">6.9 Diagnostic files from POTPH</A></H2>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><B> misc.dat         </B><DD><P>Header file for quick reference. </P>
<DT><B> phaseNN.dat </B><DD><P>Complex phase shifts for each shell.</P>
<DT><B> phminNN.dat </B><DD><P>Real part of phase shifts for l=0,1,2 only.</P>
<DT><B> potNN.dat        </B><DD><P>Detailed atomic potentials and densities.</P>
<DT><B> atomNN.dat       </B><DD><P>Diagnostic information on Desclaux free atom NN.</P>
</DL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss6.10">6.10 xsect.bin, rkk.bin and xmu.dat files</A></H2>

<P>Dipole matrix elements and absolute energies for XANES calculations.
Note: the file xsect.bin does not contain the fermi-function cutoff
at the edge, while xmu.dat does. Dipole matrix elements in rkk.bin
normalized to the total cross-section in xsect.bin. 
The file xmu.dat contains both
XANES and XAFS data mu, mu_0, and chi as functions of absolute
energy E, relative energy E-e_f and wave number k. </P>
