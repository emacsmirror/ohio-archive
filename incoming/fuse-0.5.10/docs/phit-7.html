<H2><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Acknowledgments</A></H2>

<P>I mostly want to thank Matt Newville.  He suggested writing the
program in this manner and offered me several subroutines from
<SF>Feffit</SF> for my use here.  Matt and Daniel Haskel
helped me test the code from its earliest incarnations.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 To Do</A></H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> Zeros of functions.</LI>
<LI> Check that guess values are used (explicitly or implicitly) in
functions.</LI>
<LI> Add more line shapes, possibly integer factorial, Bessel's functions,
Legendre polynomial, Hermite polynomials, Gamma function, Airy
integrals, erf and erfc, Sine and Cosine Integrals, etc., etc, etc.
minimized using named columns.</LI>
<LI> Complex valued data and line shapes (ugh!)</LI>
<LI> Crystallography applications.</LI>
<LI> Improve quality of log file.</LI>
<LI> Update appendix of this document.</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you have any good suggestions for expanding the functionality of
Phit, please contact

<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Source Code Parameters</A></H2>

<P>Phit is shipped with the following hard-wired parameters:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
      parameter (ndatx=2**13, nrangx=10, ndocx=19)
      parameter (ntitx=19, nfunx=100, nconx=300)
      parameter (nguesx=50, nsetx=300)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

These parameters are defined as follows: 
<OL>
<LI> <CODE>ndatx</CODE>:  max number of input data points</LI>
<LI> <CODE>nrangx</CODE>: max number of fitting range delimiters in input data</LI>
<LI> <CODE>ndocx</CODE>:  max number of documents in i/o data</LI>
<LI> <CODE>ntitx</CODE>:  max number of title lines</LI>
<LI> <CODE>nfunx</CODE>:  max number of input functions</LI>
<LI> <CODE>nconx</CODE>:  max number of constants to be encoded</LI>
<LI> <CODE>nguesx</CODE>: max number of guessed values</LI>
<LI> <CODE>nsetx</CODE>:  max number of set values</LI>
</OL>
 
If any of these are too small, they can be changed in the source code
and the source code can be recompiled. </P>



<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7 Code Portability and Code Compilation</A></H2>

<P>The 1977 ANSI Standard for Fortran has been followed closely, so that
<SF>Phit</SF> should easily compile on any machine and run without
any problems.  The only significant departures from Fortran 77 are the
assumption of the ASCII character set and the use of
<CODE>integer*2</CODE> variables for the UWXAFS binary file handling
routines. </P>
<P>There are, unfortunately, aspects of Fortran which are machine- and
compiler-dependent by design.  One such aspect occurs in <SF>Phit</SF> in
the form of a compiler-dependent dimension for the ``word-length'' of
the data in the UWXAFS binary files.  The code cannot easily be made
truly standard without significant changes to the UWXAFS binary file
handling routines.  The distributed code will, however, work on most
machines, with the notable exception of a Vax or Alpha running VMS.
Changing the second executable statement of <SF>Phit</SF> from <CODE>vaxflg
= .false.</CODE> to <CODE>vaxflg = .true.</CODE> will optimize the code for a VMS
machine.</P>
<P>The UWXAFS binary file handling routines also use character strings
which are 2048 characters long.  Though standard, some compilers need
to be told to accept character strings this long.  The notable example
of such a compiler is <I>xlf</I> (for AIX, IBM's Unix flavor), which
needs the compiler switch <CODE>-qcharlen=2048</CODE>.  While compiling on any
machine, we recommend including some form of array bounds checking.
If you have any problems with the compilation, it may be worthwhile to
turn off compiler optimization flags.  There may be some persistent,
benign compiler warnings when you compile <SF>Phit</SF>.  There may also
be ``comparison is always false'' warnings when using <I>f2c</I>.  These
can both be safely ignored.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8 Adding More Data Formats to Phit</A></H2>

<P>If the two data file formats (UWXAFS, ASCII) are not acceptable or
convenient to your needs (that is, if you prefer using some other
format), other choices could be added with a minimal amount of coding.
The input and output of data files is fairly well-isolated, with
subroutine <CODE>inpdat</CODE> and <CODE>outdat</CODE> controlling
which data format to use.  If you'd like another file format either
contact us about it or follow the example of the routines
<CODE>inpcol</CODE> and <CODE>outcol</CODE>, which read and write
files in the ASCII column data format. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.9">7.9 About this document.</A></H2>

<P>This document was composed using a mark-up language called
<CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE>.  This is the documentation standard of the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu//pub/linux/docs/linux-doc-project/LDP-Manifesto">Linux Documentation Project</A>.  <CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE> is an
adaptation of the QWERTZ document type definition written by Tom
Gordon.  <CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE> is available on 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu//pub/linux/utils/text/linuxdoc-sgml-1.2.tar.gz">the net</A>.</P>
<P>The value of a Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) is that it
can be processed into any number of formats from a common source.
Using <CODE>linuxdoc-sgml</CODE>, a single marked up file can be used to produce
LaTeX, PostScript, plain ASCII, HTML, TeXinfo, or dvi
documentation.</P>
