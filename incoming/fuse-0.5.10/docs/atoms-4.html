<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Absorption Calculation and Experimental Corrections</A></H2>



<P>Included in <SF>atoms</SF> is data from <I>Compilation of X-Ray Cross
Sections</I> by McMaster, et al.  Using this and the crystallographic
information from <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE>, <SF>atoms</SF> is able to make several
calculations useful for XAFS analysis.  It approximates the absorption
depth and edge step size of the material at the edge energy of the
core atom and estimates three corrections needed for the analysis of
XAFS data.  These corrections are the ``McMaster correction'', the
energy response of the I0 chamber in a fluorescence experiment, and
the self-absorption of a thick material in a fluorescence experiment.
All of these numbers are written at the top of the output file.  For
more information on these calculations consult Chapter 10 of
<I>Handbook of Synchrotron Radiation, v.1.</I></P>


<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Absorption Calculation</A></H2>


<P>Proper sample preparation for an XAFS experiment requires knowledge of
the absorption depth and edge step size of the material of interest.
The statistics of data collection can be optimized by choosing the
correct sample thickness.  It is also necessary to avoid distortions
to the data due to thickness and large particle size effects. </P>
<P><SF>atoms</SF> calculates the total cross section of the material above
the edge energy of the central atom and divides by the unit cell
volume.  The number obtained, <I>mu_total</I>, has units of
cm&circ;-1.  Thus, if x is the thickness of the sample in cm, the
x-ray beam passing through the sample will be attenuated by
<I>exp(-mu_total * x)</I>.</P>
<P><SF>atoms</SF> also calculates the change in cross section of the central
atom below and above the absorption edge and divides by the unit cell
volume.  This number, delta_mu, multiplied by the sample
thickness in cm gives the approximate edge step in a transmission
experiment.</P>
<P>The density of the material is also reported.  This number assumes
that the bulk material will have the same density as the unit cell.
It is included as an aid to sample preparation.</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 McMaster Correction</A></H2>


<P>Typically, XAFS data is normalized to a single number representing the
size of the edge step.  While there are compelling reasons to use this
simple normalization, it can introduce an important distortion to the
amplitude of the chi(k) extracted from the absorption data.  This
distortion comes from energy response of the bare atom absorption of
the central atom. This is poorly approximated away from the edge by a
single number.  Because this affects the amplitude of chi(k)
and not the phase, it can be corrected by including a Debye-Waller
factor and a fourth cumulant in the analysis of the data. These two
``McMaster corrections'' are intended to be additive corrections to any
thermal or structural disorder included in the analysis of the XAFS. </P>
<P><SF>atoms</SF> uses data from McMaster to construct the bare atom
absorption for the central atom. <SF>atoms</SF> then regresses a quadratic
polynomial in energy to the natural logarithm of the constructed
central atom absorption.  Because energy and photo-electron wave
number are simply related, E is proportional to k&circ;2, the
coefficients of this regression can be related to the XAFS
Debye-Waller factor and fourth cumulant. The coefficient of the term
linear in energy equals <I>2*sigma_MM&circ;2</I> and the
coefficient of the quadratic term equals <I>4</I>3 *
sigma_MM&circ;4/.  The values of <I>sigma_MM&circ;2</I> and
<I>sigma_MM&circ;2</I> are written at the top of the output file.</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 I0 Correction.</A></H2>



<P>The response of the I0 chamber varies with energy during an XAFS
experiment.  In a fluorescence experiment, the absorption signal is
obtained by normalizing the IF signal by the I0 signal.  There is no
energy response in the IF signal since all atoms fluoresce at set
energies.  The energy response of I0 is ignored by this normalization.
At low energies this can be a significant effect.  Like the McMaster
correction, this effect attenuates the amplitude of chi(k) and is is
well approximated by an additional Debye-Waller factor and fourth
cumulant. </P>
<P><SF>atoms</SF> uses the values of the nitrogen, argon and krypton keywords
in <CODE>atoms.inp</CODE> to determine the content of the I0 chamber by
pressure.  It assumes that the remainder of the chamber is filled with
helium. It then uses McMaster's data to construct the energy response
of the chamber and regresses a polynomial to it in the manner
described above.  <I>sigma_I0&circ;2</I> and
<I>sigma_I0&circ;4</I> are also written at the top of the output
file and intended as additive corrections in the analysis.</P>




<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Self-Absorption Correction.</A></H2>



<P>If the thickness of a sample is large compared to absorption length of
the sample and the absorbing atom is sufficiently concentrated in the
sample, then the amplitude of the chi(k) extracted from the data taken
on it in fluorescence will be distorted by self-absorption effects in
a way that is easily estimated.  The absorption depth of the material
might vary significantly through the absorption edge and the XAFS
wiggles.  The correction for this effect is well approximated as
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>1 + mu_abs / (mu_background+mu_fluor)</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>where <I>mu_background</I> is the absorption of the non-resonant
atoms in the material and <I>mu_fluor</I> is the total absorption
of the material at the fluorescent energy of the absorbing atom.
<SF>atoms</SF> constructs this function using the McMaster tables then
regresses a polynomial to it in the manner described above.
<I>sigma_self&circ;2</I> and <I>sigma_self&circ;4</I> are
written at the top of the output file and intended as additive
corrections in the analysis. Because the size of the edge step is
affected by self-absorption, the amplitude of chi(k) is attenuated
when normalized to the edge step.  Since the amplitude is a measure of
<I>S0&circ;2</I>, this is an important effect.  The number reported in
<CODE>feff.inp</CODE> as the amplitude factor is intended to be a
multiplicative correction to the data or to the measured
<I>S0&circ;2</I>.</P>
