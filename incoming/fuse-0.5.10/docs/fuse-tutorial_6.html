<P>
Several time throughout this tutorial, we plotted graphical output using
the specialize and built-in plotting functions in @fuse{}.  In this
chapter, I will describe how these functions work and how you can
further interact with GNUPLOT from within Emacs.

</P>
<P>
One of the files that ships with @fuse{} is <TT>`gnuplot.el'</TT> which
defines <SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> for Emacs.  <SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> is an emacs
major mode for creating gnuplot scripts and sending them to gnuplot.  In
the <TT>`docs'</TT> directory of the @fuse{} distribution there is a
reference card for <SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> called <TT>`gpelcard.ps'</TT>.  This
is a two page summary of the features of <SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> in
PostScript format.  You should refer to that for complete details about
<SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
The basic idea behind <SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> is that you can create a
script for GNUPLOT in the <SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> buffer and use
functions to send parts or all of the script to a GNUPLOT process.
The various plotting functions in @fuse{} work by reading the input file
to determine the names of the files to plot<A NAME="DOCF5" HREF="fuse-tutorial_foot.html#FOOT5">(5)</A> and writes a script in the
<SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> buffer.  It then uses the function for sending the
entire buffer to GNUPLOT to display the plot.

</P>
<P>
For many common plotting chores during your analysis of EXAFS data, it
quite suffices to simply use the functions offered by @fuse{}.  For
looking at such common things as fit results and background removals,
these functions work well.  The nice feature of the manner in which
@fuse{} creates its graphical output is that it leaves you with a script
that you can modify.  Often it is simple and quicker to modify one of
the scripts written by @fuse{} than to create an entire script from
scratch.

<SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> provides four functions for sending parts of scripts
to <CODE>gnuplot</CODE>.  There are functions for sending the line currently
occupied by the screen cursor (<KBD>C-c C-l</KBD>), a marked region (<KBD>C-c
C-r</KBD>), or an entire buffer (<KBD>C-c C-b</KBD>).  There is also a function
for sending an external file (<KBD>C-c C-f</KBD>) to GNUPLOT.  All four
of these can be found in the <SAMP>`Gnuplot'</SAMP> menu.  The line, region, and
buffer functions are also bound to the toolbar in XEmacs.

@fuse{} maintains a history of scripts sent to GNUPLOT.  If you
want to revisit an earlier plot, either one written by @fuse{} or one
that you wrote and sent to GNUPLOT, you can navigate the script
history.  <KBD>C-c C-p</KBD> steps backwards to previous scripts and <KBD>C-c
C-n</KBD> steps forward to more recent scripts.  These twop commands are bound
to the up and down arrows in the XEmacs toolbar for <SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP>.

</P>
<P>
<SAMP>`gnuplot mode'</SAMP> also offers keyword completion, interaction with the
GNUPLOT document, syntax colorization of GNUPLOT keywords, and
direct interaction with the GNUPLOT process.  See the reference
card for more details.
