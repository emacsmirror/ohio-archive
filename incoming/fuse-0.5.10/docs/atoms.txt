  1.  Overview

  atoms writes a list of atomic coordinates for any crystal given its
  crystallographic information. The list will be sorted by radial
  distance from an atom chosen as the central atom. atoms also estimates
  the bulk absorption and density of the material and various
  corrections to XAFS data due to experimental effects.

  atoms runs from an input file, which uses keywords to specify the
  input parameters. The code requires a file called atoms.inp.  Because
  some operating systems are case sensitive the code will search for
  ATOMS.INP if atoms.inp is not found. The output is a text file that
  can serve as the input file for feff.  This file will run feff5 or
  feff6 but not feff3 or feff4.

  atoms.inp must contain all the data necessary to uniquely specify the
  crystal.  The information that the program requires is:

  1. The Hermann-Maguin or Schoenflies notation for the crystal space
     group. The notation conventions are slightly modified to work with
     a keyboard. This document lists all 230 groups as recognized by the
     program.

  2. The non-redundant, non-default cell axis lengths and angles between
     the axes.

  3. The two letter symbol and cell coordinates of each unique atom. The
     definition of unique atom is an atom occupying a unique
     crystallographic site.  Sodium chloride (NaCl) has two unique atoms
     that must be specified.  In Lead Titanate (PbTiO3), for example,
     there are two unique oxygen sites, so four unique atoms must be
     specified.  One of the atoms must be chosen as the central atom.

  Usually this data can be taken directly from the crystallography
  literature.  When confusion arises, consult The International Tables
  of X-Ray Crystallography.  This is the standard by which the program
  was written.

  Chapter 3 should be read carefully.  That chapter explains all of the
  conventions necessary to specify crystallographic information in
  atoms.  This is a wonderful program in that it quickly generates a
  list of atomic coordinates for an arbitrarily complicated crystal.  It
  is an awful program in that it requires you, the user, to speak its
  language. There are numerous quirks and limitations to the algorithms
  that interpret unit cell structure.  Much error checking is included
  in the code.  If atoms finds something in the input file that it does
  not like, it should give a useful run-time message.

  The output is a file that can be used to run feff, the ab initio
  multiple scattering XAFS code written by Rehr and Zabinsky. The atom
  positions are organized into a list in the format read by feff.  atoms
  makes reasonable guesses for several other inputs to feff.  The
  feff.inp file generated by atoms will run feff to completion.

  atoms has been extensively tested, but is not guaranteed to be free of
  bugs.  If you are displeased with the result of a run and you have
  followed all of the instructions and hints in this document, then you
  may have found a bug.  To report your bug, first capture to a file all
  screen messages from the run with the suspect input file.  Send the
  screen messages, the input file, and any output files to the author.
  Also tell what kind of computer you are using and which Fortran
  compiler you used to make the executable.  You will find the author's

  2.  Keywords

  2.1.  General Format

  Take a peek at Appendix B.  Included there are many examples of input
  files for atoms.  Each one specifies lattice parameters, a space
  group, positions of atoms within the unit cell, and a few other pieces
  of information. The purpose of this chapter is teach you how to
  construct input files, thus to communicate with atoms.

  atoms.inp uses keywords to describe the inputs. With only a few
  exceptions, the keywords are allowed to occur in any order in the
  file, and usually have transparent meanings.  This structure allows
  the input file to be easily read and modified.  All keywords use the
  syntax:

               keyword delimiter value(s) delimiter ...

  The delimiter can be:

  1. one or more white spaces (blanks and/or TABs)

  2. one equal sign and any number of white spaces

  3. one comma and any number of white spaces

  Most keywords take only one value. Many keywords can be put on one
  line (though some keywords require their own line).  Internal comments
  can be written anywhere in atoms.inp, which help remind you what the
  keywords mean, or how you chose the input values. Keywords can be in
  upper, lower, or mixed case. atoms is not sensitive to the case of
  keywords or their values.

  2.2.  List of Keywords

  Here is a summary of keywords and their meanings.  The following
  sections give more detailed explanations for each keyword.  Where
  appropriate, default values are given in brackets.

  2.3.  Explanations of Keywords

      * or % or !
        Everything after one of these characters on a line in the input
        file will be ignored by atoms.

      Title
        Indicates a user-chosen title line which will be written to
        feff.inp.  9 title lines of 72 characters each can be used.
        Everything on a line after the keyword title will be included in
        the title.  If keywords are on the line following title, they
        will be read as part of the title, not as separate keywords.
        The word comment is synonymous with title.

      Space
        This keyword is followed by the Hermann-Maguin or Schoenflies
        designation for the space group.  Complete lists of these
        designations are are found in Appendix A.  Because the Hermann-
        Maguin designation, as adapted for the keyboard, includes
        spaces, this keyword is handled specially by atoms. space should
        be on its own line or at the end of a line.

      A This specifies the first lattice constant.  A must always be
        specified.  In a cubic or rhombohedral space groups, where only
        one lattice parameter is needed, A is the one to specify.

      B This specifies the second lattice constant.  It is set equal to
        A unless specified.

      C This specifies the third lattice constant.  It is set equal to A
        unless specified.  In tetragonal, or hexagonal space groups,
        this is the second lattice constant that must be specified.

      Alpha
        This specifies the angle between B and C.  Specify the angle in
        degrees.  This is the angle that must be specified for
        rhombohedral space groups.  The default value is 90 deg.

      Beta
        This specifies the angle between C and A.  Specify the angle in
        degrees.  The default value is 90 deg.  This is the angle that
        must be specified for monoclinic space groups.

      Gamma
        This specifies the angle between A and B.  Specify the angle in
        degrees.  The default value is 90 deg for orthogonal groups and
        120 deg for hexagonal and trigonal groups.

      Core
        This specifies the absorbing atom.  The value of this keyword
        must be a site tag.  This atom will be placed at the center of
        the cluster and will be used as the central atom in the McMaster
        and fluorescent correction calculations.  The central atom must
        be specified by this keyword.  This is a change from early
        versions of atoms. This keyword has no default.  A central atom
        must be specified.  The keyword central is synonymous with core.

      Rmax
        This specifies the maximum radial distance in the cluster of
        calculated atomic coordinates.

      Index
        This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.
        Along with the coordinates, the atom list in feff.inp contains
        the symbol of each atom.  With the index feature turned off,
        only the two letter symbol of each atom is printed.  With it
        turned on, atoms of the same type will be numbered sequentially
        according to distance.  To enable this feature, the syntax is

                  index  true

     An example: in pure copper, the 12 nearest neighbors will be
     labeled Cu01, the 6 next neighbors will be labeled Cu02, and so on.
     Without indexing, all the atoms will be labeled Cu.

      Shift
        Moves all atoms in the atom list by the specified amount. This
        keyword takes three real numbers as its values.  The syntax is:

                  shift  xvalue  yvalue  zvalue

     The value of the shift vector is simply added to all fractional
     atomic coordinates in the atom list.  Read the section on Multiple
     Origins in section 3.6 for a discussion of the usefulness of this
     keyword.

      Out
        This specifies an output file name other than feff.inp.  It can
        be up to 72 characters, so can include a directory path as well
        as the file name.  If out = list is specified then a file called
        atoms.lis will be written instead of feff.inp.  atoms.lis will
        contain the title lines and the coordinate list but none of
        headers or feff keywords.  This option is useful for
        applications other than feff that require a list of atomic
        coordinates.

      Edge
        This specifies the absorption edge of the central atom.  If edge
        is not specified, the default value is determined from the Z of
        the central atom.  For central atoms with Z<=57, the K edge is
        chosen.  For heavier atoms, the L3 edge is chosen.  K, L1, L2,
        and L3 are the only values for edge recognized by atoms.

      Nitrogen
        This number specifies the percentage by pressure of nitrogen gas
        in the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment.  Specifying
        either this keyword or the argon or krypton keywords tells atoms
        to estimate the corrections to the data due to the energy
        response of the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the
        sample.  These calculations are described in detail in chapter
        4.  This keyword takes a real number between 0 and 1 as its
        value. The default is that the fluorescence calculations are
        turned off.

      Argon
        This number specifies the percentage by pressure of argon gas in
        the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment.  Specifying
        either this keyword or the nitrogen or krypton keywords tells
        atoms to estimate the corrections to the data due to the energy
        response of the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the
        sample.  These calculations are described in detail in chapter
        4.  This keyword takes a real number between 0 and 1 as its
        value. The default is that the fluorescence calculations are
        turned off.

      Krypton
        This number specifies the percentage by pressure of krypton gas
        in the I0 chamber in a fluorescence XAFS experiment.  Specifying
        either this keyword or the nitrogen or argon keywords tells
        atoms to estimate the corrections to the data due to the energy
        response of the I0 chamber and the self-absorption of the
        sample.  These calculations are described in detail in chapter
        4.  This keyword takes a real number between 0 and 1 as its
        value. The default is that the fluorescence calculations are
        turned off.

      Geom
        This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  If
        true, atoms will write a file called geom.dat for use in the
        path finder module of feff.  If geom.dat is written, the NOGEOM
        card will be written to feff.inp.

      Unit
        This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  If
        true, atoms will write a file called unit.dat contining the
        atomic coordinates of all atoms in the unit cell as well as all
        atoms on the walls, edges, and corners of the unit cell.

      P1
        This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  If
        true, atoms will write a file called p1.inp.  This file is a
        valid input file for atoms.  It contains the entire contents of
        the unit cell in the atoms list and has the space keyword set to
        p 1, the monoclinic space group of no internal symmetries.  All
        axes and angles are explicitly specified in p1.inp, as are core,
        edge, rmax, and all of the title lines.

      Feff
        This is a logical flag, thus takes a value of true or false.  By
        default it is true and will write out feff.inp.  If it is false,
        atoms will not calculate the cluster of atoms, thus will not
        write out either feff.inp or geom.dat.

      Dopant
        This keyword specifies the type and percent substitution of a
        dopant material.  The syntax is:

                  dopant  dp  tag  percentage

     Where dp is the atomic symbol of the doping atom, tag is the site
     tag of the site where the dopant resides, and the percentage is a
     real number between 0 and 1 specifying the amount of substitution.
     If tag is an atomic symbol rather than a site tag, then all sites
     containing that atomic species will affected.

      Atom
        This must be the last keyword in the input file.  If it is not
        the program will almost certainly stop running.  This keyword
        tells the program to go to the next line and begin reading in
        the unique atom coordinates.  The atom list is a five column,
        structured list.  Column one is the two letter atomic symbol
        (not the Z number).  Columns two through four contain the x, y,
        and z coordinates of each atom.  These numbers are entered as
        fractions of the a, b, and c axes respectively.  The fifth
        column contains the site tag. See section 2.4 for an explanation
        of the site tags.  The keywords atom and basis are incompatible.
        If both are specified in an input file, the program will stop
        running.

      Basis
        This must be the last keyword in the input file.  If it is not
        the program will almost certainly stop running.  This keyword
        tells the program to go to the next line and begin reading in
        the basis atom coordinates.  The basis list is a five column,
        structured list.  Column one is the two letter atomic symbol
        (not the Z number).  Columns two through four contain the x, y,
        and z coordinates of each atom.  These numbers are entered as
        fractions of the a, b, and c axes respectively.  The fifth
        column contains the site tag. See section 2.4 for an explanation
        of the site tags.  A basis may be constructed around an empty
        site.  Specify that site with the word null rather than an
        atomic symbol.  The keywords atom and basis are incompatible.
        If both are specified in an input file, the program will stop
        running.

  2.4.  Specifying Site Tags and the Central Atom

  The central atom of the cluster written to feff.inp must be explicitly
  specified with the keyword core.  To avoid ambiguity in a situation
  involving inequivalent crystallographic sites containing the same
  atomic species, the value of this keyword must be a site tag.  The
  site tags are the user supplied character strings which appear in the
  fifth column of the atom or basis list.

  Users of Atoms 2.41 and prior versions: This is the most important
  difference between atoms 2.42 and versions numbered 2.41 and lower.
  Previously the fifth column of the atom or basis list was used to
  specify the central atom.  The addition of site tags used to label the
  different sites requires specification of the central atom by keyword.

  The fifth column of the atom list contains the site tag.  The user may
  label the sites in any way desired and these labels may be up to 10
  characters long.  The sites must be labeled uniquely or else atoms
  will become confused if one of the sites labeled redundantly is chosen
  as the core atom.  If a tag is not specified for a site then the
  default tag will be used.  The default for a site tags is to label
  that site with the atomic symbol of the occupying atom.  Remember that
  atoms is insensitive to case, thus the tag THISATOM is the same as
  thisatom and ThisAtom.

  Here is an example.  Note that the the value of core is a tag, not an
  element symbol.

                 title YBCO: Y Ba2 Cu3 O7  (1-2-3 structure)

                 --------------------------------------------

  This is the atoms.inp for superconducting Y Ba2 Cu3 O7.  Notice that
  the copper and oxygen sites are tagged with unique labels.  The
  central atom is specified with one of these labels -- the Cu1 site
  will be at the center of the cluster written to feff.inp.  The yttrium
  and barium sites are tagged with the atomic symbol by default.  Since
  each of these species occupies only one site, there is no ambiguity in
  using the atomic symbol as the tag.

  In feff.inp each atom will be identified by its tag, not by its atomic
  symbol.  Assignment of unique potentials, however, is based on atomic
  species.  If you wish to assign unique potentials based on
  crystallographic considerations, you will need to edit feff.inp.

  2.5.  Basis List v. Atom List

  atoms has the ability to recognize basis vectors.  For some lattice
  types this is a somewhat nicer way of describing the structure.  In
  introductory solid state physics texts, the diamond structure is often
  described as face centered cubic with a two atom basis.  For example,
  silicon might be specified as a diamond structure crystal with a
  unique atom at position (1/8, 1/8, 1/8).  It might also be specified
  as an FCC structure with a basis of (0,0,0) and (1/4, 1/4, 1/4).

  atoms handles a basis list slightly differently from an atom list.
  When given an atom list, the code translates each point in the list by
  the symmetry operations specified in the space group name.  When given
  a basis list, the code only performs these symmetry operations on one
  of the points listed.  It then constructs the basis at each of the
  points so generated.  The keyword core may select any atom in the
  basis as the central atom of the cluster.

  The best use of this feature would be to generate an atom list for a
  structure that is described by a periodic repetition of some large,
  complex local structure.  Clathrates are an excellent example of this.

  One very important rule must be followed when using a basis list.  The
  first atom in the list must correctly represent the desired
  translation symmetry.  In the case of silicon, the basis must be
  translated like the point (0,0,0) in space group F m 3 m (the space
  group of FCC crystals) to yield the diamond structure. Thus the first
  atom in the basis list for silicon must be at (0,0,0) or else the
  basis will not be expanded correctly.

  A basis can be constructed around an empty site, by specifying the
  coordinates of the empty site as the first entry in the basis list and
  entering the word null instead of an atomic symbol.  The null site
  will not appear in the atom list in feff.inp.  The keyword core may
  not take null as a value.

  To finish the example of silicon, here are two input files that give
  the same output:

                title   Si, fcc with a two atom basis
                a = 6.485  space F m 3 m      ! space group of fcc
                rmax=6.5  core=si1
                basis
                  Si   0.0    0.0    0.0   si1
                  Si   0.25   0.25   0.25  si2
                -----------------------------------------

                title    Si, diamond structure
                a = 6.485  space F d 3 m      ! space group of diamond
                rmax  6.5
                atom
                  Si  0.125  0.125  0.125
                -----------------------------------------

  See section 3.7 for an explanation of why the silicon atom in the
  second example must be at (1/8, 1/8, 1/8) rather than at (0,0,0).

  2.6.  Dopants

  atoms handles dopants in the simplest possible fashion.  It assumes
  all dopants are substitutional and that there are no correlations
  between cells regarding which lattice sites are occupied by doping
  atoms.  Furthermore, atoms makes no assumptions about which physical
  sites are occupied by dopants.  Thus the atom list written to feff.inp
  is the list for the undoped structure.  atoms uses information about
  the dopants in the following ways:

  o  For calculating the density, the absorption, and the experimental
     corrections.

  o  A dopant may be the central atom in the atom list, thus the
     calculations mentioned above will be performed at the absorption
     edge of the dopant.

  The syntax is:

                   dopant   dp   tag   percentage

  where dp and tag are character strings and percentage is a number
  between 0 and 1.  The value of dp is the atomic symbol of the dopant.
  The value of tag is the site tag of the site where the dopant resides.
  If the value of tag is an atomic symbol then all sites containing that
  atomic species will be doped.

  atoms allows up to 3 dopants per site and no more than 9 in the entire
  crystal.  If this is insufficient, then you have a mess on your hands.
  You also have my sympathy -- contact me and I will help you alter the
  code to accommodate your horrid problem.

  The atomic species specified for a site by the dopant keyword need not
  be the minority component.  This might be useful for uniquely
  specifying the core atom.   Vacancies may be introduced by doping
  sites with null.

  Analyzing a doped material in fine structure spectroscopies is
  complicated.  The simple scheme that I describe in this section is
  useful for several of the calculations in the code, but is clearly
  insufficient for the task of resolving the local structure of a doped
  material.  That atoms writes the atom list in feff.inp using the
  undoped structure is indicative of this.

  2.7.  Geom.dat

  The path finder in feff has an option to use crystal symmetries in
  order to speed the determination and computation of all paths.  This
  is done by providing a file called geom.dat containing special flags
  specifying the relevant symmetries.  Setting geom = true in atoms.inp
  will tell atoms to write a geom.dat file and to place the card NOGEOM
  in feff.inp.  This leads to a large reduction of computation time only
  in crystals of high symmetry.  In an fcc structure, the reduction in
  time can be as high as a factor of about 50.  In a structure of lower
  symmetry, the savings will rarely be more than a factor of about 4.
  Use of the geom.dat generated by atoms will not effect the computation
  time of the potentials and phase shifts calculation of the first
  module of feff, nor will it effect the computation time of the
  individual paths in the third module.  The geom.dat file has the same
  atom list as the feff.inp file.

  To use the geom.dat file, it must be located in the directory in which
  feff is run.  Since the NOGEOM card is in feff.inp, feff will know to
  access at the appropriate time the geom.dat file written by atoms.
  The geom.dat file and the atom list in feff.inp should both remain
  unmodified, or else feff might get confused.  The feff card RMAX can
  be changed to limit the extent of the feff calculation without needing
  to change geom.dat.  See the feff document for more details about
  this.

  3.  Space Groups

  3.1.  Notation Conventions

  The two most commonly used standards for the designation of three
  dimensional space groups are the Hermann-Maguin and Schoenflies
  conventions.  atoms recognizes both conventions.  Each of the 230
  space groups as designated in each convention is listed in appendix A.

  The Hermann-Maguin system uses four symbols to uniquely specify the
  group properties of each of the 230 space groups.  The first symbol is
  a single letter (P, I, R, F, A, B or C) which refers to the Bravais
  lattice type. The remaining three letters refer to the point group of
  the crystal.

  Some modifications to the notation convention are made for use with a
  keyboard.  Spaces must separate each of the four symbols.  Subscripted
  numbers are printed next to the number being modified (e.g. 6_3 is
  printed as 63).  A bar above a number is entered with a minus sign.

  Occasionally there are variations in how space groups are referenced.
  For example, the hausmannite structure of Mn3 O4 is placed in space
  group I 41/A M D by the conventions laid out in The International
  Tables.  In Crystal Structures, v. 3, Wyckoff denotes this space group
  as I 4/A M D.  This sort of incongruity is unfortunate. The list of
  Hermann-Maguin space group designations as recognized by atoms is
  included in appendix A.  If you cannot resolve the incongruity using
  this list, try using the Schoenflies notation.

  The Schoenflies conventions are also recognized by atoms.  In the
  literature there is less variation in the application of these
  conventions.  The Schoenflies convention is, in fact, less precise
  than the Hermann-Maguin in that the complete symmetry characteristics
  of the crystal are not encoded in the space group designation.
  Adaptations to the keyboard have been made here as well.  Subscripts
  are denoted with an underscore (_) and superscripts are denoted with a
  caret (^).  Spaces are not allowed in the keyboard designation.  A
  couple of examples: d_4^8, and O_5. The underscore does not need to
  precede to superscript.  C_2^V9 can also be written C^V9_2.  Each of
  the 230 space groups as designated by the Schoenflies notation is
  listed in Appendix A in the same order as the listing of the Hermann-
  Maguin notation.  The two conventions are equally supported in the
  code.

  3.2.  Unique Crystallographic Positions

  The atom or basis list in atoms.inp is a list of the unique
  crystallographic sites in the unit cell.  A unique site is one (and
  only one) of a group of equivalent positions.  The equivalent
  positions are related to one another by the symmetry properties of the
  crystal.  atoms determines the symmetry properties of the crystal from
  the name of the space group and applies those symmetry operations to
  each unique site to generate all of the equivalent positions.

  If you include more than one of a group of equivalent positions in the
  atom or basis list, then a few odd things will happen.  A series of
  run-time messages will be printed to the screen telling you that atom
  positions were found that were coincident in space.  This is because
  each of the equivalent positions generated the same set of points in
  the unit cell.  atoms removes these redundancies from the atom list.
  The atom list and the potentials list written to feff.inp will be
  correct and feff can be run correctly using this output.  However, the
  site tags and the indexing of the atoms will certainly make no sense.
  Also the density of the crystal will be calculated incorrectly, thus
  the absorption calculation (section 4.1) and the self-absorption
  correction (section 4.3) will be calculated incorrectly as well.  The
  McMaster correction (section 4.2) is unaffected.

  3.3.  Specially Recognized Lattice Types

  For some common crystal types it is convenient to have a shorthand way
  of designating the space group.  For instance, one might remember that
  copper is an fcc crystal, but not that it is in space group F M 3 M
  (or O_H^5).  In this spirit, atoms will recognize the following words
  for common crystal types.  These words may be used as the value of the
  keyword space and atoms will supply the correct space group.  Note
  that several of the common crystal types are in the same space groups.
  For copper it will still be necessary to specify that an atom lies at
  (0,0,0), but it isn't necessary to remember that the space group is F
  M 3 M.

       ___________________________________________________________________
         cubic                  |   cubic                |  P M 3 M

         graphite               |   graphite             |  P 63 M C
       --------------------------------------------------------------------

  When space is set to hex or graphite, gamma is automatically set to
  120.

  3.4.  Bravais Lattice Conventions

  atoms assumes certain conventions for each of the Bravais lattice
  types.  Listed here are the labeling conventions for the axes and
  angles in each Bravais lattice.

  o  Triclinic: All axes and angles must be specified.

  o  Monoclinic: B is the perpendicular axis, thus beta is the angle not
     equal to 90.

  o  Orthorhombic: A, B, and C must all be specified.

  o  Tetragonal: The C axis is the unique axis in a tetragonal cell.
     The A and B axes are equivalent.  Specify A and C in atoms.inp.

  o  Trigonal: If the cell is rhombohedral then the three axes are
     equivalent as are the three angles.  Specify A and alpha.  If the
     cell has hexagonal axes, specify A and C.  gamma will be set to 120
     by the program.

  o  Hexagonal: The equivalent axes are A and B.  Specify A and C in
     atoms.inp. Gamma will be set to 120 by the program.

  o  Cubic: Specify A in atoms.inp.  The other axes will be set equal to
     A and the angles will all be set to 90.

  3.5.  Low Symmetry Space Groups

  In three dimensional space there is an ambiguity in choice of right
  handed coordinate systems.  Given a set of mutually orthogonal axes,
  there are six choices for how to label the positive x, y, and z
  directions.  For some specific physical problem, the crystallographer
  might choose a non-standard setting for a crystal.  The choice of
  standard setting is described in detail in The International Tables.
  The Hermann-Maguin symbol describes the symmetries of the space group
  relative to this choice of coordinate system.

  The symbols for triclinic crystals and for crystals of high symmetry
  are insensitive to choice of axes.  Monoclinic and orthorhombic
  notations reflect the choice of axes for those groups that possess a
  unique axis.  Tetragonal crystals may be rotated by 45 degrees about
  the z axis to produce a unit cell of doubled volume and of a different
  Bravais type.  Alternative symbols for those space groups that have
  them are listed in Appendix A.

  atoms recognizes those non-standard notations for these crystal
  classes that are tabulated in The International Tables.  atoms.inp may
  use any of these alternate notations so long as the specified cell
  dimensions and atomic positions are consistent with the choice of
  notation.  Any notation not tabulated in chapter 6 of the 1969 edition
  of The International Tables will not be recognized by atoms.

  This resolution of ambiguity in choice of coordinate system is one of
  the main advantages of the Hermann-Maguin notation system over that of
  Shoenflies.  In a situation where a non-standard setting has been
  chosen in the literature, use of the Schoenflies notation will, for
  many space groups, result in unsatisfactory output from atoms.  In
  these situations, atoms requires the use of the Hermann-Maguinn
  notation to resolve the choice of axes.

  Here is an example.  In the literature reference, La2 Cu O4 was given
  in the non-standard b m a b setting rather than the standard c m c a.
  As you can see from the axes and coordinates, these settings differ by
  a 90 degree rotation about the A axis.  The coordination geometry of
  the output atom list will be the same with either of these input
  files, but the actual coordinates will reflect this 90 degree
  rotation.

  --------------------------------------

  3.6.  Rhombohedral Space Groups

  There are seven rhombohedral space groups. Crystals in any of these
  space groups that may be represented as either monomolecular
  rhombohedral cells or as trimolecular hexagonal cells.  These two
  representations are entirely equivalent.  The rhombohedral space
  groups are the ones beginning with the letter R in the Hermann-Maguin
  notation. atoms does not care which representation you use, but a
  simple convention must be maintained.  If the rhombohedral
  representation is used then the keyword alpha must be specified in
  atoms.inp to designate the angle between the rhombohedral axes and the
  keyword a must be specified to designate the length of the
  rhombohedral axes.  If the hexagonal representation is used, then a
  and c must be specified in atoms.inp.  Gamma will be set to 120 by the
  code.  Atomic coordinates consistent with the choice of axes must be
  used.

  3.7.  Multiple Origins and the Shift Keyword

  Some space groups in The International Tables are listed with two
  possible origins.  The difference is only in which symmetry point is
  placed at (0,0,0).  atoms always wants the orientation labeled
  ``origin-at-centre''.  This orientation places (0,0,0) at a point of
  highest crystallographic symmetry. Wyckoff and other authors have the
  unfortunate habit of not choosing the ``origin-at-centre'' orientation
  when there is a choice.  Again Mn3 O4 is an example.  Wyckoff uses the
  ``origin at -4m2'' option, which places one Mn atom at (0,0,0) and
  another at (0,1/4,5/8).  atoms wants the ``origin-at-centre''
  orientation which places these atoms at (0,3/4,1/8) and (0,0,1/2).
  Admittedly, this is an arcane and frustrating limitation of the code,
  but it is not possible to conclusively check if the ``origin-at-
  centre'' orientation has been chosen.

  Twenty one of the space groups are listed with two origins in The
  International Tables for X-Ray Crystallography.  atoms knows which
  groups these are and by how much the two origins are offset, but
  cannot know if you chose the correct one for your crystal.  If you use
  one of these groups, atoms will print a run-time message warning you
  of the potential problem and telling you by how much to shift the
  atomic coordinates in atoms.inp if the incorrect orientation was used.
  This warning will also be printed at the top of the feff.inp file.  If
  you use the ``origin-at-center'' orientation, you may ignore this
  message.

  If you use one of these space groups, it usually isn't hard to know if
  you have used the incorrect orientation.  Some common problems include
  atoms in the atom list that are very close together (less that 1
  angstrom), unphysically large densities (see section 4.1), and
  interatomic distances that do not agree with values published in the
  crystallography literature.  Because it is tedious to edit the atomic
  coordinates in the input file every time this problem is encountered
  and because forcing the user to do arithmetic (any good scientist's
  bugaboo!) invites trouble, there is a useful keyword called shift.
  For the Mn3 O4 example discussed above, simply insert this line in
  atoms.inp if you have supplied coordinates referenced to the incorrect
  origin:

                     shift = 0.0  0.25  -0.125

  This vector will be added to all of the coordinates in the atom list
  after the input file is read.

  Here is the input file for Mn3 O4 using the shift keyword:

              title  Mn3O4, hausmannite structure, using the shift keyword
                 a   5.75   c  9.42    core Mn2
              rmax   7.0    Space  i 41/a m d
              shift  0.0  0.25  -0.125
              atom
              ! At.type  x        y       z        tag
                 Mn     0.0      0.0     0.0       Mn1
                 Mn     0.0      0.25    0.625     Mn2
                 O      0.0      0.25    0.375
              -------------------------------------------------

  The above input file gives the same output as the following.  Here the
  shift keyword has been removed and the shift vector has been added to
  all of the fractional coordinates.  These two input files give
  equivalent output.

  4.  Absorption Calculation and Experimental Corrections

  Included in atoms is data from Compilation of X-Ray Cross Sections by
  McMaster, et al.  Using this and the crystallographic information from
  atoms.inp, atoms is able to make several calculations useful for XAFS
  analysis.  It approximates the absorption depth and edge step size of
  the material at the edge energy of the core atom and estimates three
  corrections needed for the analysis of XAFS data.  These corrections
  are the ``McMaster correction'', the energy response of the I0 chamber
  in a fluorescence experiment, and the self-absorption of a thick
  material in a fluorescence experiment.  All of these numbers are
  written at the top of the output file.  For more information on these
  calculations consult Chapter 10 of Handbook of Synchrotron Radiation,
  v.1.

  4.1.  Absorption Calculation

  Proper sample preparation for an XAFS experiment requires knowledge of
  the absorption depth and edge step size of the material of interest.
  The statistics of data collection can be optimized by choosing the
  correct sample thickness.  It is also necessary to avoid distortions
  to the data due to thickness and large particle size effects.

  atoms calculates the total cross section of the material above the
  edge energy of the central atom and divides by the unit cell volume.
  The number obtained, mu_total, has units of cm^-1.  Thus, if x is the
  thickness of the sample in cm, the x-ray beam passing through the
  sample will be attenuated by exp(-mu_total * x).

  atoms also calculates the change in cross section of the central atom
  below and above the absorption edge and divides by the unit cell
  volume.  This number, delta_mu, multiplied by the sample thickness in
  cm gives the approximate edge step in a transmission experiment.

  The density of the material is also reported.  This number assumes
  that the bulk material will have the same density as the unit cell.
  It is included as an aid to sample preparation.

  4.2.  McMaster Correction

  Typically, XAFS data is normalized to a single number representing the
  size of the edge step.  While there are compelling reasons to use this
  simple normalization, it can introduce an important distortion to the
  amplitude of the chi(k) extracted from the absorption data.  This
  distortion comes from energy response of the bare atom absorption of
  the central atom. This is poorly approximated away from the edge by a
  single number.  Because this affects the amplitude of chi(k) and not
  the phase, it can be corrected by including a Debye-Waller factor and
  a fourth cumulant in the analysis of the data. These two ``McMaster
  corrections'' are intended to be additive corrections to any thermal
  or structural disorder included in the analysis of the XAFS.

  atoms uses data from McMaster to construct the bare atom absorption
  for the central atom. atoms then regresses a quadratic polynomial in
  energy to the natural logarithm of the constructed central atom
  absorption.  Because energy and photo-electron wave number are simply
  related, E is proportional to k^2, the coefficients of this regression
  can be related to the XAFS Debye-Waller factor and fourth cumulant.
  The coefficient of the term linear in energy equals 2*sigma_MM^2 and
  the coefficient of the quadratic term equals 43 * sigma_MM^4/.  The
  values of sigma_MM^2 and sigma_MM^2 are written at the top of the
  output file.

  4.3.  I0 Correction.

  The response of the I0 chamber varies with energy during an XAFS
  experiment.  In a fluorescence experiment, the absorption signal is
  obtained by normalizing the IF signal by the I0 signal.  There is no
  energy response in the IF signal since all atoms fluoresce at set
  energies.  The energy response of I0 is ignored by this normalization.
  At low energies this can be a significant effect.  Like the McMaster
  correction, this effect attenuates the amplitude of chi(k) and is is
  well approximated by an additional Debye-Waller factor and fourth
  cumulant.

  atoms uses the values of the nitrogen, argon and krypton keywords in
  atoms.inp to determine the content of the I0 chamber by pressure.  It
  assumes that the remainder of the chamber is filled with helium. It
  then uses McMaster's data to construct the energy response of the
  chamber and regresses a polynomial to it in the manner described
  above.  sigma_I0^2 and sigma_I0^4 are also written at the top of the
  output file and intended as additive corrections in the analysis.

  4.4.  Self-Absorption Correction.

  If the thickness of a sample is large compared to absorption length of
  the sample and the absorbing atom is sufficiently concentrated in the
  sample, then the amplitude of the chi(k) extracted from the data taken
  on it in fluorescence will be distorted by self-absorption effects in
  a way that is easily estimated.  The absorption depth of the material
  might vary significantly through the absorption edge and the XAFS
  wiggles.  The correction for this effect is well approximated as

       1 + mu_abs / (mu_background+mu_fluor)

  where mu_background is the absorption of the non-resonant atoms in the
  material and mu_fluor is the total absorption of the material at the
  fluorescent energy of the absorbing atom.  atoms constructs this
  function using the McMaster tables then regresses a polynomial to it
  in the manner described above.  sigma_self^2 and sigma_self^4 are
  written at the top of the output file and intended as additive
  corrections in the analysis. Because the size of the edge step is
  affected by self-absorption, the amplitude of chi(k) is attenuated
  when normalized to the edge step.  Since the amplitude is a measure of
  S0^2, this is an important effect.  The number reported in feff.inp as
  the amplitude factor is intended to be a multiplicative correction to
  the data or to the measured S0^2.

  5.  A Worked Example

  Here is an example of atoms in action.  The material is Lead Titanate,
  PbTiO3. The crystallographic literature places this material in the
  tetragonal space group P 4 M M.  The data was taken in fluorescence at
  the titanium K-edge.  Since the edge energy is around 5 KeV and the
  sample was very thick, the I0 and self-absorption corrections are
  expected to be significant.  That titanium is the central atom is
  indicated by the keyword core.  atoms assumes the K-edge of the
  titanium was probed because the atomic number of titanium is less than
  57 and the edge was not otherwise chosen with the edge keyword.  The
  I0 chamber was filled with 92% helium and 8% nitrogen by pressure.
  This is indicated by the nitrogen keyword.  The indexing feature is
  engaged with the index keyword.  The size of the cluster to be printed
  in feff.inp is chosen with the rmax keyword.

  atoms produces the output reproduced below.  The absorption and
  correction calculations are at the top of the file.  All the CONTROL
  cards are set to 1 and the PRINT cards are set to 0.  This will run
  all four modules of feff and produce the default output files.
  Several other useful feff cards are printed but commented out by an
  asterisk (*).  The unique potential list is constructed in a simple
  fashion -- the core atom is potential 0 and each different atomic
  species has a single potential.  The atom list is printed in the
  format required by feff.  The atom list has two comment columns.  The
  indexed atomic symbol and radial distance are written by atoms for
  your use when reading feff.inp and are ignored by feff.

  feff will run to completion using the input file generated by atoms.
  It is still likely that the user will want to edit feff.inp. Several
  assumptions are made by atoms that might not hold true.  The
  assignment of unique potentials is made by a simple algorithm and may
  not adequately reflect the physics of the problem.  The CONTROL cards
  are such that all four modules of feff will be run.  The feff user
  might want to run the modules separately.  Values for other cards have
  been assumed and might not be desired.  Other cards have been left out
  entirely.  Always check your feff.inp file to be sure it is just what
  you want.

  6.  Program Notes

  6.1.  Acknowledgments

  I would like to thank my many colleagues who have been a source of
  help and inspiration.  The support of Profs. Ed Stern and John Rehr
  has always been appreciated.  I would like to thank Chuck Bouldin,
  Boyan Boyanovich, Julie Cross, Tim Elam, Matt Newville, Hans Stragier,
  Kalle Voss, Steve Zabinsky, and Yanjun Zhang for their contributions,
  helpful criticism and useful suggestions as I have developed this
  program.

  The essential calculation in this program is handled in the routine
  equipt, which decodes the Hermann-Maguin notation and performs the
  proscribed symmetry operations on the input atomic coordinates.  This
  routine was written by H. Burzlaff and A. Hountas and is in the public
  domain. Several parts of this program were inspired by the program
  sexie by Bernhard Rupp.  sexie uses input files that are similar to
  atoms.inp and its database is a good resource for composing atoms.inp
  files.  The original version of the routine mucal was written by P.
  Bandyopadhyay using data from Compilation of X-Ray Cross Section by
  McMaster et. al.  Several of the character string manipulation
  routines (triml, istrln, upper, lower, bwords) were written by S.I.
  Zabinsky and M. Newville and released for this use.

  6.2.  Comments on the Fortran Code

  Every routine used by atoms has been written in ANSI standard
  Fortran-77.  At the time of this writing the code has been found to
  compile and run under many difffernt operating systems.  Presently,
  the code is developed on an Intel 486 laptop which runs Linux using
  F2C and GCC for compilation.  The code is thus easily ported to any
  machine with a Fortran compiler.  The author has run atoms under four
  different unixes, MS-DOS, Macintosh System 7.5, Vax-VMS, and Open-VMS
  on an DEC Alpha.  At this time, there are four caveats for the user:

  1. In the main program, the unit for the output files are opened with
     status unknown. On VMS machines, it is more convenient, but not
     necessary, to open files with new status to take advantage of
     multiple versions of files.  To change this for use on a Vax-VMS
     machine, search for the line in the main program where the variable
     vaxflg is defined and change it to .true.

  2. All run-time messages are written by the subroutine messag. Thus if
     your machine has particular requirements for writing to standard
     output, messag should be the only routine that you need to alter.

  3. Tab characters are allowed in the input file, even though the
     handling of tab characters might be machine specific.  This is done
     by reading a line from the input file and filtering it through a
     subroutine called untab, which replaces tab characters with blank
     spaces.  untab is written assuming tab is ASCII character 9.  If
     your machine handles this differently, you only need to edit untab
     or simply don't use tabs.

  4. The character string manipulation assumes the ASCII character set.
     If your machine does not use ASCII, then you are probably familiar
     with how to alter code for use on your machine.  Contact the author
     for which subroutines need to be altered.

  If you ever have a problem with carriage-control while using atoms or
  feff with a feff.inp file generated by atoms, please contact the
  author.

  atoms is delivered with the following parameter values:

  1. iat = 20, maximum number of unique atoms

  2. natx = 800, maximum number of atoms in cluster

  3. ntitx = 9, maximum number of title lines

  4. maxln = 800, maximum number of atoms in feff.inp

  feff limits the size of the cluster in its calculation to 400 atoms.
  In atoms these values are imposed by parameter statements, thus are
  easy to change.  Global parameters such as these are set in the main
  program and passed as arguments to the rest of the program.  Find
  these near the beginning of the main program and change them to
  whatever value you want.  If you do not know exactly how to do this
  but still think you need to, consult your local Fortran guru or, if
  you must, the author.

  The source code for atoms is written in a style with mostly lower case
  characters.  All executable statements are written in lower case.
  This is a departure from strict adherence to the ANSI standard.  Care
  has been taken to make the code insensitive to case.  That is, the
  source may be placed in all upper case or all lower case without
  damaging its functionality.  The algorithm that parses the input file
  is certainly insensitive to case.

  6.3.  What is new since version 2.42

  1. Correct handling of hexagonal space groups.  This is the most
     important new feature.  My chagrined thanks to the many people who
     discovered this little problem and took the time to tell me about
     it.  I also improved handling of trigonal and rhombohedral space
     groups.

  2. Support for notations of all settings of orthorhombic, tetragonal,
     and monoclinic space groups.  atoms is now fully compliant with all
     Hermann-Maguin short notations as specified in The International
     Tables of X-Ray Crystallography, 1969 edition.

  3. Better recognition of Schoenflies notation.

  4. Improved error messages.  Hopefully my error messages are now more
     informative and spelled correctly.

  5. Improvements to the calculations using the McMaster tables.  I have
     also corrected a few incorrect values that have been found in the
     electronic version of the McMaster tables.

  6. Addition of p1 and krypton keywords.

  7. Improved writing of geom.dat files.

  8. Improved handling of input and output filenames.

  9. Allow L1 and L2 edges for feff.inp.

  10.
     Writing of five digits after the decimal places in feff.inp.  This
     matches the precision of feff's degeneracy checker.

  11.
     Writing of edge energy in the HOLE line of feff.inp.  This is for
     informational purposes only, it serves no purpose in feff.

  6.4.  Naming Conventions

  Between versions 2.41 and 2.42, my program had a name change.  Earlier
  versions were called atom, while later versions are called atoms, with
  an s.  The reason for this change was to avoid confusion with the
  subroutine atom that is an important part of feff.  Hopefully this
  reduces confusion rather than adds to it!  For now, the version number
  is incremented by 0.01 when minor functionality is added and by 0.1
  when major functionality is added.  Bug corrections have been denoted
  with an incrementing letter appended to the version number.

  This document was composed using a mark-up language called linuxdoc-
  sgml.  This is the documentation standard of the Linux Documentation
  Project.  linuxdoc-sgml is an adaptation of the QWERTZ document type
  definition written by Tom Gordon.  linuxdoc-sgml is available by ftp
  at ftp.cc.gatech.edu.  The document type definition was altered
  somewhat to meet the needs of the UWXAFS documentation.

  The value of a Standardized General Markup Language (SGML) is that it
  can be processed into any number of formats from a common source.
  Using linuxdoc-sgml, a single marked-up file can be used to produce
  LaTeX, PostScript, plain ASCII, html, TeXinfo, or dvi documentation.

  7.  Appendix A -- Denoting Space Groups

  This appendix is my attempt to demystify the crazy symbolism used by
  the Hermann-Maguin and Schoenflies conventions.  This is by no means
  an adequate explanation of the rich and beautiful field of
  crystallography.  For that, I recommend one of the books in the
  bibliography.

  An important part of the demystification process is to define some of
  the important terms used to describe crystal symmetries. The words
  system, Bravais lattice, crystal class, and space group have well-
  defined meanings.  The symbols used in each of the notation
  conventions specifically relate the various symmetries of crystals.
  In crystallography, a symmetry operation is defined as a sequence of
  reflections, translations, and/or rotations that map the crystal back
  onto itself in such a way that the crystal after the mapping is
  indistinguishable from the crystal before the mapping.

  7.1.  A Quick Review of Crystallography

  To start, here are some definitions.  These will be elaborated below.

  o  System: The undecorated shape of the unit cell.

  o  Bravais Lattice: An undecorated lattice of equivalent points.

  o  Crystal Class: The description of the symmetries about a point.

  o  Space Group: The complete description of three dimensional crystal
     symmetries.

  There are seven systems of crystals.  The system refers to the shape
  of the undecorated unit cell. They are:

  1.  Triclinic: a >< b >< c, alpha >< beta >< gamma >< 90 deg

  2.  Monoclinic: a >< b >< c, alpha=gamma=90 deg, beta >< 90 deg

  3.  Orthorhombic: a >< b >< c, alpha=beta=gamma=90 deg

  4.  Tetragonal: a = b >< c, alpha=beta=gamma=90 deg

  5.  Hexagonal: a = b >< c, alpha=beta=90 deg, gamma=120 deg

  6.  Trigonal: (rhombohedral axes): a = b = c,  alpha=beta=gamma < 120
     deg >< 90 deg
      (hexagonal axes): a = b >< c, alpha=beta=90 deg, gamma=120 deg

  7.  cubic: a = b = c,   alpha=beta=gamma=90 deg

  There are fourteen Bravais lattices.  The Bravais lattices are
  constructed from the simplest translational symmetries applied to the
  seven crystal systems.  A P lattice has decoration only at the corners
  of the unit cell.  An I lattice has decoration at the body center of
  the cell as well as at the corners.  An F lattice has decoration at
  the face centers as well as at the corners.  A C lattice has
  decoration at the center of the (001) face as well as at the corners.
  Likewise A and B lattices have decoration at the centers of the (100)
  and (010) faces respectively.  R lattices are a special type in the
  trigonal system which possess rhombohedral symmetry.
  All seven crystal systems have P lattices, but not all the classes
  have the other type of Bravais lattices.  This is because there is
  degeneracy when all the Bravais lattice types are applied to all the
  crystal systems.  For example, a face centered tetragonal cell can be
  expressed as a body centered tetragonal cell by rotating the two
  equivalent axes by 45 deg and shortening them by a factor of square
  root of 2.  Considering such degeneracies reduces the possible
  decorations of the seven systems to these 14 unique three dimensional
  lattices:

           Triclinic      P
           Monoclinic     P, C
           Orthorhombic   P, C, I, F
           Tetragonal     P, I
           Hexagonal      P
           Trigonal       P, R
           Cubic          P, I, F

  For historic reasons, hexagonal cells are sometimes called C lattices.
  atoms will recognize hexagonal P cells denoted in atoms.inp by the
  letter C.  Modern literature usually uses the P designation.

  The decorations placed on the Bravais lattices come in 32 flavors
  called classes or point groups which represent the possible symmetries
  within the decorations.  Each type of symmetry is defined either by a
  reflection plane, a rotation axis, or a rotary inversion axis.  A
  reflection plane can either be a simple mirror plane or a glide plane,
  which defines the symmetry operation of reflecting through a mirror
  followed by translating along a direction in the plane.  A rotation
  axis can either define a simple rotation or a screw rotation, which is
  the symmetry operation of rotating about the axis followed by
  translating along that axis.  A rotary inversion axis defines the
  symmetry operation of reflecting through a plane followed by rotating
  about an axis in that plane.

  These three symmetry types, reflection plane, rotation axis, and
  rotary inversion axis, can be combined in 32 non-degenerate ways.  (An
  example degeneracy: the symmetry operation of combining a 180 deg
  rotary inversion with a mirror reflection is identical to the
  operation of a simple 180 deg rotation.)  It would seem that the 32
  classes could decorate the 14 Bravais lattices in 458 ways.  In fact,
  the number might be larger as there are numerous types of screw axes
  and glide planes.  Again, considering degeneracies reduces the total
  number of combinations, leaving 230 unique decorations of the Bravais
  lattices.  These are called space groups.  The 230 space groups are a
  rigorously complete set of descriptions of crystal symmetries in three
  dimensional space.  That is, there may be new crystals but there are
  no new space groups.  Here I am only considering space-filling
  crystals with translational periodicity.  3-D Penrose structures and
  quasi-crystals are outside the realm of this appendix and of the code.

  7.2.  Decoding the Hermann-Maguin Notation

  The Hermann-Maguin notation uses a set of two to four symbols to
  completely specify the symmetries of a space group. The first symbol
  is always a single letter specifying the Bravais lattice.  The next
  three symbols specify the class of the space group.  These three
  symbols are some combination of the following characters:

                            1 2 3 4 5 6 A B C D M N / -

  These are sufficient to completely specify the various planar and
  axial symmetries of the classes and sub-classes.  The following is a
  discussion of the most important rules of this convention.  Some
  details are neglected but sufficient information is provided to
  appreciate the information contained in the notation.

  The second symbol in the Hermann-Maguin notation, i.e. the one after
  the Bravais lattice symbol, tells about symmetries involving the
  primary axis of the cell and/or of the plane normal to the primary
  axis.  The primary axis is defined as follows:

  1.  Triclinic: none

  2.  Monoclinic: the B axis

  3.  Orthorhombic: the C axis

  4.  Tetragonal: the C axis

  5.  Hexagonal: the C axis

  6.  Trigonal: the A axis

  7.  Cubic: the A axis

  In cubic or rhombohedral lattices the axes are equivalent, thus the
  primary axis is arbitrary.  For orthorhombic lattices the third and
  fourth symbols specify the symmetries of the a and b axes
  respectively.  In other lattices, the last two symbols encode the
  remaining symmetries as described below.

  A space filling crystal will always show a symmetry when rotated
  through (360/n) degrees, where n is one of {1,2,3,4, or 6}.  The
  second symbol often tells the rotational symmetry properties of the
  primary axis.  Notice that all trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal
  groups have a 3, 4, or 6 respectively in their designations.  Many
  orthorhombic and monoclinic groups have a 2, which is the highest
  degree of rotational symmetry available to those lattices.  Cubic
  groups may possess 2- or 4-fold rotational symmetry about the cell
  axes, thus have 2 or 4 in the second symbol.

  Many second symbols contain a second number.  This is the subscripted
  number when the Hermann-Maguin notation is typeset.  This refers to
  the type of screw symmetry associated with the axis.  A screw
  symmetric lattice is mapped onto itself by an anti-clockwise rotation
  through m * (360/n) degrees and a translation of 1/n up the primary
  axis.  Here n is the degree of rotational symmetry, m is the type of
  screw, and the definition of rotation and direction is right-handed.
  Two types of screw symmetry that are different only in handedness of
  rotation are called enantiomorphous.  The enantiomorphous pairs are 31
  and 32, 41 and 43, 61 and 65, and 62 and 64.

  Several of the second symbols are one or two numbers followed by a
  slash and a letter, e.g. P 63/M M C.  The letter specifies the type of
  reflection plane that is normal to the rotation axis.
  There are several types of reflection planes.  The simplest is a
  mirror plane, denoted by the letter M.  This says the crystal is
  mapped onto itself by reflecting all atoms through a mirror placed in
  an appropriate plane in the crystal.  The letters A, B, or C denote
  glide planes.  These map the crystal onto itself by reflecting through
  the plane then translating elements of the crystal by half the length
  of the cell axis normal to the reflection plane.  A D glide plane is
  similar but involves translations of a quarter of the cell axis
  length.  Finally, the letter N denotes a diagonal glide plane, which
  is a reflection through a plane followed by a translation in the same
  plane of half the length of both cell axes in that plane.

  The symbol - before a number indicates a rotary inversion axis.  This
  maps the crystal back onto itself by rotating through (360/n) deg then
  reflecting through a plane parallel to the rotation axis.

  A final word about the Hermann-Maguin notation.  All cubic space
  groups have four three-fold rotational axes through the body
  diagonals.  Thus all cubic groups have the number 3 as the third
  symbol.

  7.3.  Decoding the Schoenflies Notation

  The Schoenflies notation uses a set of three symbols to classify sets
  of space groups by their dominant symmetry features.  The letters C,
  D, S, T, and O denote the character of the center of symmetry.  The
  symbol after the underscore (the subscript when typeset) indicates the
  presence of symmetry planes and additional symmetry axes.  The number
  after the caret (the superscript when typeset) is simply an indexing
  of all the distinct space groups that share major symmetry properties.
  In the older literature, D symmetry centers are occasionally referred
  to as V.  atoms will probably understand a space group referred to by
  the letter V, but using the D notation is recommended.

  The letter C indicates an rotation axis where the crystal is mapped
  onto itself when rotated by (360/n) deg, where n is the number after
  the underscore.  An H after the underscore indicates the presence of a
  plane of symmetry normal to the rotation axis.  A V after the
  underscore indicates one or two planes of symmetry parallel to the
  rotation axis.  The letter S after the underscore indicates a normal
  plane of symmetry in a crystal where the degree of rotational symmetry
  is 1. The letter I after the underscore indicates the presence of a
  point center of symmetry.

  The letter S indicates a rotary inversion axis. The degree of rotation
  is the number after the underscore.

  The letter D denotes a primary rotation axis with another rotation
  axis normal to it.  The degree of rotation of both axes is the number
  after the underscore.  The letters H and V have the same meanings as
  they did in groups beginning with the letter C .  The letter D
  indicates the presence of a diagonal symmetry plane.

  Cubic groups are all specified by the letters T and O.  T indicates
  tetrahedral symmetry, that is, the presence of the four three-fold
  axes and three two-fold axes.  O indicates octahedral symmetry, i.e.
  four three-fold axes with three four-fold axes.  H and D after the
  underscore carry the same meaning as before.

  7.4.2.  Nonstandard Notations

  Here are the notations for the alternate settings of the monoclinic
  and orthorhombic space groups.  Also presented are the notations for
  tetragonal space groups that have been rotated by 45 degrees resulting
  in a unit cell of doubled volume and of a different Bravais type.

  In an monoclinic or orthorhombic space group, the Hermann-Maguin
  symbols are identical for the various settings if none of the three
  axes possess special symmetry properties.  In this case the three axes
  are distinguished only by length and the symbol is the same for all
  settings.

  The column headings below indicate the orientations of the alternative
  settings relative to the standard setting.  For instance, cab is a
  setting with axes and coordinates cyclically permuted from the
  standard setting.  This is equivalent to a rotation of 120 degrees
  about an axis in a <111> direction relative to the Cartesian axes.
  The setting a-cb is rotated by 90 degrees about the A axis.  Thus the
  B and C axes are swapped and the y and z coordinates in the standard
  setting map onto the z and -y coordinates of the alternate setting.
  In atoms, when an alternative setting is specified in atoms.inp, the
  axes and coordinates are multiplied by the appropriate permutation
  matrix onto the standard setting.  The positions in the unit cell are
  expanded according to the Hermann-Maguin symbol for the standard
  setting.  The contents of the unit cell are then permuted back to the
  specified setting.

  8.  Appendix B -- 40 Example Input Files

  The next several pages have numerous examples of atoms.inp files that
  produce the correct output.  In these examples you might find a
  material of interest or its isomorph and you will certainly get clues
  for making atoms work the way you want.  By far the most useful
  resource for the crystallographic data needed for these input files is
  the Crystal Structures series by R.W.G. Wyckoff.

  These examples and many others are available on the Internet.  The
  World wide Web URL for a big list of input files is
  http://krazy.phys.washington.edu/html/atoms.html.  The FTP address is
  krazy.phys.washington.edu.  Log in as anonymous and give your e-mail
  address as a password.  The example input files are in the directory
  /pub/Tools/Atoms/.  Please feel free to contribute new input files
  that you have used.  Upload them by FTP to the directory
  /pub/Incoming/.

  8.4.  High Temperature Superconductors.

  Here are several examples of atoms.inp files for various High Tc
  superconductors.  The crystallographic literature on this class of
  materials is quite large and there are significant structural
  differences even between similar materials.  Two recommended resources
  for crystal information are Copper Oxide Superconductors by Poole,
  Datta, and Farach, Wiley-Interscience, New York (1988) and Physical
  Properties of High Temperature Superconductors II, ed. by Ginsberg,
  World Scientific (1990).
