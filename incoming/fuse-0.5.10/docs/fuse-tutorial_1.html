<P>
In this tutorial, I will lead you step by step through the analysis of
some copper data.  Along the way, we will explore many of the features
of @fuse{}.  In this tutorial I assume that you, the reader, are
familiar with the physics of EXAFS and the principles of EXAFS analysis.
I also assume that you are familiar with FEFF and the UWXAFS
programs, although you certainly do not have to be an expert in their
use.  In fact, working through this tutorial is a good way to explore
some of the features of those programs.  I make some effort in this
tutorial to accomodate the Emacs novice.  It is possible that a reader
may have been drawn to @fuse{} despite not being a convert to the
religion of Emacs.<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="fuse-tutorial_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>  For that
reader, I try to offer enough guidance that she can get through the
entire tutorial without having to know too many magic Emacs key
sequences.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="fuse-tutorial_toc.html#TOC2">Using Emacs</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
As an aid to the Emacs-non-expert, I will explain some of the notation
that I will use in the pages to come.  Many tasks in Emacs (using
@fuse{} or performing any other editing chore) involce the use of
modifier keys.  When you read something like <KBD>C-c</KBD>, that means to
hold down the <KBD>ctrl</KBD> key while hitting the <KBD>c</KBD> character.
<KBD>C-c C-r r</KBD> then means to hit <KBD>ctrl</KBD> and <KBD>c</KBD> followed by
<KBD>ctrl</KBD> and <KBD>r</KBD> followed by <KBD>r</KBD>.  In Emacs jargon <KBD>M-</KBD> is
read as <CODE>Meta</CODE> and, on most keyboards, refers either to the
<KBD>alt</KBD> or <KBD>esc</KBD> key.  These two can be used interchangably,
however these two keys typically behave somewhat differently.  When you
read <KBD>M-n</KBD> that means <EM>either</EM> to hit the <KBD>alt</KBD> and <KBD>n</KBD>
keys at the same time <EM>or</EM> to hit the <KBD>esc</KBD> key followed by the
<KBD>n</KBD> key.  <KBD>S-</KBD> is interpretted the same as <KBD>C-</KBD> except that
it means to hold the <KBD>shift</KBD> while hitting the following character.
In a few cases, a key sequence may involve more than one modifier.
<KBD>M-C-`</KBD> means to hit <KBD>`</KBD> (that is the backtick or open quote
character) while holding down both <KBD>alt</KBD> and <KBD>ctrl</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
I will assume that you are using a three-button mouse or a mouse capable
of three-button emulation.  Throughout this document I will refer to the
mouse buttons as <CODE>mouse-1</CODE>, <CODE>mouse-2</CODE>, and <CODE>mouse-3</CODE>.
typically <CODE>mouse-1</CODE> is the left button, <CODE>mouse-2</CODE> is the
middle, and <CODE>mouse-3</CODE> is the right.  Sometimes this arrangement is
altered to suit the preferences of the user.

</P>

Most of the interactivity of Emacs occurs either via pop-up windows or
through the minibuffer.  Pop-up windows usually have text, buttons, and
menus which are fairly self-explanatory.  The minibuffer is that strip
at the bottom of the Emacs frame below the mode line.  That space is
reserved for displaying messages and for interaction with the user.
Many of the functions in @fuse{} use this space for one of those
purposes.  The phrase <EM>minibuffer</EM> is used to refer to that space
when Emacs is interacting with the user and the phrase <EM>echo area</EM>
is used to describe it when it is displaying a message
non-interactively.  I will use both terms in this document.

</P>

<P>
There are four ways of making Emacs execute a command or function.

<UL>

<LI>

<STRONG>Explicit invocation</STRONG>: This is done by hitting <KBD>M-x</KBD>
then typing the entire name of the function or command at the prompt
which appears in the minibuffer.  This method is guaranteed to work in
all but the most perverse situations, but is not how the user typically
interacts with Emacs.
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>

<LI>

<STRONG>Key sequences</STRONG>: This is the fastest way of executing commands
while editing text because it does not require moving your hands from
the keyboard.  Virtually every command in @fuse{} has a key sequence.
Key sequences are the keystrokes discussed above involving the
<KBD>ctrl</KBD>, <KBD>alt</KBD>, and normal character keys.
<A NAME="IDX7"></A>

<LI>

<STRONG>Menu selection</STRONG>: At the top of the Emacs frame is a menubar with
pull down menus.  These behave in the same manner as pull down menus in
other programs and on other systems.  Click <CODE>mouse-1</CODE> on the menu
label and a menu will open.  Click on an item in the menu and that
function will execute or click on a submenu, usually denoted by a
right-pointing triangle, and that submenu will open.  Sometimes a menu
item will be displayed in grey stipple.  This means that option is not
currently selectable.  In Emacs, the key sequence bound to same function
as a menu item is usually written in the right column of the pull down
menu.  The menus are great for searching for a certain function and also
serve to teach you the key sequences for the functions you use often.
<A NAME="IDX8"></A>

<LI>

<STRONG>Toolbar selection</STRONG>: One of the ways XEmacs differs from the
Emacs written by the Free Software Foundation is that it can display
images within the frame.  It therefor offers a iconic toolbar.  @fuse{}
binds several of the most commonly used functions to a toolbar that
typically is displayed on the left side of the frame.  Click
<CODE>mouse-1</CODE> on a toolbar icon to execute the function bound to it.  A
short description of the function appears in the echo area whenever the
mouse is over the toolbar icon.
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>

</UL>

<P>
@ifnotinfo

</P>
<P>
If you have a Emacs open in front of you, click <CODE>mouse-1</CODE> on
the <CODE>Input</CODE> menu.  The contents of this menu are shown in Figure 1.
This menu and its submenus will be referred to throughout this tutorial.
If you click any mouse button anywhere else on your screen, the menu
will disappear without anything selected.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="fuse-tutorial_toc.html#TOC3">Starting an Analysis Problem with FUSE</A></H2>

<P>
In the <CODE>example</CODE> subdirectory of the @fuse{} distribution are two
files related to this tutorial.  (1) <TT>`cu10k.dat'</TT> contains copper
<VAR>K</VAR> edge transmission data on a pure copper foil.  (2) <TT>`copper'</TT>
contains crystallographic data for metallic copper.

</P>
<P>
Both analysis of data and the use of @fuse{} are facilitated by
practical and consistent use of th directory structure and disk space
where you do you work.  Throughout this example I will refer to files
foudn in certain locations.  These examples reflect my own preference
for how to organize the many files generated by the various programs
used to analyze the data.  Although I encourage you to come up with
practices for managing files with which you are comfortable, I suggest
that you follow my lead during this example and experiment once you are
more familiar with @fuse{}.

</P>
<P>
Remember that the the <CODE>Buffers</CODE> menu or the key sequences <KBD>C-x
b</KBD> or <KBD>C-x C-b</KBD> can be used to switch between different buffers.  A
file is saved by hitting <KBD>C-x C-s</KBD> or selecting the save function
from the <CODE>Files</CODE> menu.  A new file is opened by hitting <KBD>C-x f</KBD>
or selecting <CODE>Open...</CODE> from the <CODE>Files</CODE> menu.  Finally, you
can quit Emacs by hitting <KBD>C-x C-c</KBD> or <CODE>Exit Emacs</CODE> from the
<CODE>Files</CODE> menu.

Before launching into using @fuse{}, let's set up some workspace.  I am
writing this assuming you are parked at a command line in a terminal
emulator, but these disk management chores could just as easily be done
with a file manager such as The Midnight Commander or tkDesk or with the
<CODE>dired</CODE> package in Emacs.  On my computer, I have a directory where
I do all of my analysis which is called, appropriately enough,
<TT>`analysis/'</TT>.  Find a place where you want to do the analysis chore
in this tutorial and <KBD>cd</KBD> to that directory.  Now make a directory
to hold your analysis of the copper data by issuing the command

<PRE>
    &#62; mkdir Cu
</PRE>

<P>
Now <KBD>cd</KBD> to the <TT>`Cu/'</TT> directory.  This will be our base of
operations for the remainder of this tutorial.

</P>
<P>
I like to be tidy and place common kinds of files in their own
subdirectories.  in the <TT>`Cu/'</TT> directory, issue this command

<PRE>
    &#62; mkdir data feff fits
</PRE>

<P>
This will make three subdirectories for holding the differnt kinds of
files that will be generated throughout this tutorial.

</P>
<P>
Now, using the <KBD>cp</KBD> command, copy the file <TT>`cu10k.dat'</TT> from the
@fuse{} distribution into the <TT>`data/'</TT> subdirectory and copy the
<TT>`copper'</TT> file into the <TT>`feff/'</TT> subdirectory.

</P>
<P>
Ready for some analysis?

<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="fuse-tutorial_toc.html#TOC4">A Few Notes About this Document</A></H2>

<P>
This document was prepared using the GNU Texinfo system.  This allows me
to generate documentation in info, printed, or html format from a single
source.  The info, postscript, and html versions of this document can be
found in the <TT>`docs/'</TT> subdirectory of the @fuse{} distribution.

</P>
<P>
The images in this document are screen shots of an XEmacs session on my
computer.  I use Linux 2.0.32, XEmacs 20.4, and the FVWM2 window
manager.  Some of the text in shots of actual input files is a bit hard
to read in the printed manual.  This is because of the greyscale
representation of the syntax colorization of the text.  It may be fuzzy
in the printed manual, but it looks great on the screen!

</P>
<P>
Although all of my screen shots are of an XEmacs session, @fuse{} works
just as well with FSF Emacs as with XEmacs.  The only difference
significant to this tutorial is the presence of the toolbar in the
XEmacs frame.  Since all functionality bound to the XEmacs toolbar is
also bound to pull-down menus, this tutorial proceeds identically for
both flavors of Emacs.
