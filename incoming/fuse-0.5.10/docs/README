Notes.

Several of these documents can be recreated from their source files.
The FUSE user's guide and tutorial were prepared from the Texinfo
(version 3.12) source and so require the texinfo.tex file from the
3.12 distribution.  The FUSE and gnuplot-mode reference cards were
prepared from the latex source and require the supertabular, fancybox,
amsmath, and amssymb packages.


The various gif, jpg, and eps files as well as several .txt files are
the figure files used in the various forms of the tutorial.
