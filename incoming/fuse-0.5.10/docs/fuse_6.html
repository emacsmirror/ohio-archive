<P>
I do things in @fuse{} as I need them for my own work.  That puts a
severe limit on how much gets done.  If I ever develop a user base, some
of the ideas that I have that I can live without would perhaps get done.
I find Emacs to be a really wonderful application interface and I have
not really used all of its potential or implemented all of my ideas.
Any of these things may happen some day.  If I ever get some kind of
real user base, that would be incentive for finishing off this list and
even tackling some new problems.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><STRONG>File parsing</STRONG>
<DD>
Do a simple syntax checking of the entire buffer -- make sure that
values match the expectation of a keyword, that named files exist, that
keywords are not dangling, and the like.  This already works for
individual keywords, but I would like @fuse{} to check entire files.  A
display of problems and a facility for jumping to the location of the
problem, <EM>a la</EM> compilation-mode, would be great.

<DT><STRONG>Execution parsing</STRONG>
<DD>
The run-time output of all the programs is displayed in a run-time
buffer.  This output could be parsed in the event of an unsuccessful run
much in the manner of the standard compilation utility which allows you
jump to the problem line in the source code at a keystroke.  The
inconsistent screen messages of FEFF and the UWXAFS programs
make this difficult, although ATOMS will offer a uniform style of
screen messages starting with version 2.50.

<DT><STRONG>Better UWXAFS binary integration</STRONG>
<DD>
A dired-like mode for interacting with uwxafs binary files (or even a
packed ASCII representation of the many-records-one-file concept) would
be quite slick.  This is way down on my priority list because (1) I
rarely use the UWXAFS format and (2) I would rather see it go away (or
be replaced by something better, packed ASCII, zip, other?).

<DT><STRONG>More plotting options</STRONG>
<DD>
Gnuplot is really rather primitive, but it is clean and easy to interact
with.  Another freely available and fairly common plotting option is
XMGR.  It really would not be too hard to make an XMgr interface in a
similar vein to the current gnuplot interface.  XMgr has the advantages
of, among other things, a cursor and focusing.  Others possibilities
are PGPLOT integration and ...?

<DT><STRONG>NTEmacs integration</STRONG>
<DD>
It'd be pretty cool if FUSE worked on NT.  I can't imagine it would take
<EM>that</EM> much work.

<DT><STRONG>and ...</STRONG>
<DD>
I'm open to suggestions!
