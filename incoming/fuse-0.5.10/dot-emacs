;;; input mode additions to the .emacs file

;;; Insert the following lines somewhere in your .emacs file to enable
;;; input mode and the various program minor modes.
;;;
;;; If you have been using the old feffit-mode or prior versions of
;;; FUSE, be sure to comment out or delete the appropriate lines lines
;;; from your .emacs file

;;  change this directory to whatever |
;;  is appropriate for you           / \
;;                             vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv

;; to enable syntax colorization using the font-lock package, you
;; should have either
;;     (font-lock-mode)
;; or
;;     (global-font-lock-mode t)
;; in your .emacs file.

;; --- input mode customization ------------------------------------
;; To customize the behavior of FUSE, do one of the following:
;;  1) Use an "input-mode-hook", an example of which is given below,
;;     defined in your .emacs file.
;;  2) Use a .fuse file in which the variables are setq-ed without a hook.
;;     See the example .fuse file called dot-fuse that comes with the
;;     FUSE distribution
;;  3) If you are using an Emacs with the customization package, type
;;     `M-x customize-group' and respond with `fuse', then set the variables
;;     to appropriate values

;; This example is trivial in that it sets a few variables to their
;; default values.  See the documentation for an explanation of the
;; meanings of these variables.

;; (add-hook 'input-mode-hook
;; 	  '(lambda ()
;; 	     (setq fuse-base-directory              "/home/bruce/xlisp/fuse/")
;; 	     (setq input-stanza-indent              0)
;; 	     (setq input-intrp-buffer-name          "intrp.dat")
;; 	     (setq input-gnuplot-r-column           4)
;; 	     ))
