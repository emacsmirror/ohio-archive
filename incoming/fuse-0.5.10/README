See INSTALL for installation directions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The FUSE distribution contains the following:

1.  Makefiles for GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

2.  A bunch of files that end in .el.  These are the main programs in
    FUSE.

3.  The docs/ directory contains documentation for FUSE as well as for
    atoms and feff in a variety of formats, including info, html,
    PostScript and plain text.

4.  The pixmaps/ directory contains all of the icons used in the
    toolbars in XEmacs.

5.  The scripts/ directory contains several shell and perl scripts
    used by FUSE.

6.  The fortran/ directory contains lsfile and mrofer (programs useful
    for handling uwxafs binary files), a copy of normal (for aligning
    and normalizing mu(E) data), and a copy of phit (a generalized
    least-squares fitting program).  I have not yet written a
    Makefile for these.  If you need to compile these -- they are
    standard fortran 77.  Use g77, f2c and gcc, or any other fortran
    compiler. 

7.  The emulation/ directory contains some files useful if you want
    Emacs to emulate vi, edt, or crisp while using FUSE.  This is not
    really described in the documentation.  Contact Bruce if you need
    to do this.

8.  The example/ directory contains files that you will need for the
    tutorial.  It also has an 3 example Atoms input files demonstrating
    the definition and evaluation line syntax introduced in version
    0.5.4 of FUSE.

9.  Example .emacs and .fuse files called `dot-emacs' and `dot-fuse'

Some general notes:

1.  FUSE handles uwxafs binary files to some extent.  I am open to
    suggestions for improvement.

2.  The document is spotty in places, particularly in the discussion
    of minor mode specific functions, and in some of the newer
    features, such as the gnuplot history and batch program execution.

3.  The emulation stuff is spottily described.  If you want to use
    FUSE with vi (or other editor) emulation, contact me.

4.  The FUSE welcome screen is poorly described, but it works and
    might be handy for you.  Start emacs and do a M-x fuse-mode to
    check it out.

5.  Work through the tutorial.  It will introduce to many of the
    features of FUSE. 

6.  Get calc from ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/calc-2.02f.tar.gz.
    It is easy to install.  The definition and evaluation line syntax
    new to Atoms mode in FUSE 0.5.4 requires calc.

7.  Look at my web page
	http://feff.phys.washington.edu/~ravel/software.html#elisp
    It has some tips and other information not covered in the
    document. 

8.  Do you have nifty ideas for what FUSE could do?  Let me know!
