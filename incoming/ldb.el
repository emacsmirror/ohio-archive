;;; Commentary:
;;
;; lbdb.el is an emacs interface to the Little Brother's Database. You can
;; find out more about LBDB at <URL:http://www.spinnaker.de/lbdb/>.
;;
;; Two commands are provided, `lbdb' and `lbdb-last'. `lbdb' lets to perform
;; an interactive query on the lbdb while `lbdb-last' allows you to recall
;; and work with the results of the last query you performed.
;;
;; The latest lbdb.el is always available from:
;;
;;   <URL:http://www.hagbard.demon.co.uk/archives/lbdb.el>
;;   <URL:http://www.acemake.com/hagbard/archives/lbdb.el>

;;; BUGS:
;;
;; o Mouse selection doesn't work in XEmacs.

;;; INSTALLATION:
;;
;; o Drop lbdb.el somwehere into your `load-path'. Try your site-lisp
;;   directory for example (you might also want to byte-compile the file).
;;
;; o Add the following autoload statement to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'lbdb "lbdb" "Query the Little Brother's Database" t)

;;; Code:
