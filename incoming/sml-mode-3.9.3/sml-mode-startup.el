Run an inferior ML process, input and output via buffer *sml*. 
With a prefix argument, this command allows you to specify any command
line options to pass to the complier. The command runs hook functions
on `comint-mode-hook' and `inferior-sml-mode-hook' in that order.

If there is a process already running in *sml*, just switch to that
buffer instead. 

In fact the name of the buffer created is chosen to reflect the name
of the program name specified by `sml-program-name', or entered at the
prompt. You can have several inferior ML process running, but only one
current one -- given by `sml-buffer' (qv).
