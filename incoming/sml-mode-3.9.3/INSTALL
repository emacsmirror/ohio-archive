SML-MODE shouldn't require any special external support package,
as far as I can rememebr.  Just a recent copy of Emacs or XEmacs.

Installation of the program
===================================

  1. Edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your site.
     The only things you have to change is the definition of `lispdir'
     and `infodir'.  The elisp files will be copied to `lispdir', and
     the info file to `infodir'.

  2. Have some sorbet.

  3. Type `make install' in the source directory.  This will
     byte-compile all `.el' files and copy all the
     `.elc' files into the directory you specified in step 1.
     It will also copy the info files (and add a corresponding entry to the
     info-dir file if install-info can be found).

     If you want to install the `.el' files,
     just type ``make install_el''.

     If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but don't
     want to install them, you can type `make elcfiles' instead.

  4. Edit the file `site-start.el' in your emacs lisp directory (usually
     `/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp' or something similar) and enter the
     contents of the file `sml-mode-startup.el' into it.  It contains
     a couple of `auto-load's that facilitates the use of sml-mode.
     Alternatively, you can just use `make install_startup'.
     If you're only installing it for yourself rather than for the whole system,
     then use something like `make install_startup startupfile=$HOME/.emacs'.

  5. If you already had copied the pcl-cvs.startup.el file to your
     site-start.el (or .emacs), you might want to check if it is still correct
     since autoloads might have been added/removed.


How to make typeset documentation from the TeXinfo manual
=========================================================

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset version of
the manual typing ``make dvi''.  If you prefer a postscript version of this
file, just use ``make postscript''.
