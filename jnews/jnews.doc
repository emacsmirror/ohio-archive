Original Documentation by Josh Marantz

I'm sure people have had it up to their modelines with news packages,
but you may really like this one.  Why?  Because its small, fast, and
fairly powerful given its small set of features.  We've been using
it here at Viewlogic for a while, and it definitely makes wading through
reems of high-volume newsgroups much quicker.

It is used on newsgroups like Dired is used on files.  In fact, for
"select newsgroup mode", it uses Dired on the directory ~/jnews, which
contains one file for each newsgroup you read.  You select which
newsgroup you want by editing the file for it (e.g.
~/jnews/comp.emacs).  The file is maintained with the first line as
-*-jnews-*-, so it goes into jnews-mode when you edit the file.

When editing a jnews file, each message is displayed on one line,
indicating date, author, subject, number of lines, and message number.
You move the cursor to a message, and hit "e" to see it, hit
Carriage-Return to bypass it while marking it as read, and hit "*" to
mark it as unread, even if you've seen it.  Expired messages are
marked with '#', unread messages are marked with '*'.  Hitting tab
gets you to the next unexpired message.  Hitting 'x' gets rid of all
expired messages.  Hitting 'q' kills the buffer.

Help is available with '?' and 'h'.

The news-package works with a small elisp file and a small auxiliary C
program.  The C program is not linked into Emacs.  It's run with call-process.
It's used to build the summary file, which can be done faster in C than
in Elisp because the C program doesn't have to scan the whole message,
just the first few lines.

Jnews will probably not work with nntp.  Jnews assumes you have your news
in a directory tree, off of /usr/spool/news.  A small Elisp modification
would allow it to pass an alternate news-root to the jnews C program.

You must do "mkdir ~/jnews" manually before running jnews.

Anyway, I apologize for not doing a super packaging job, but people around
here have been urging me to publicize this, so maybe you'll think its
worth it.  Here's some global bindings for your .emacs, followed by
jnews.c and jnews.el.  Enjoy!

Addendum by Kim Letkeman

I have added some functionality to jnews.el and a script that will
take your .newsrc and create the summary files in your jnews
directory. It is still very small and fast and is somewhat more
convenient now to use and especially to get started. Kudos to Josh for
a nice idea and a nice implementation.

My changes to jnews.el are:

- when quitting either an article or a summary, the user is
  popped back to the buffer at the previous level. If there
  are no more articles, the user is popped all the way from
  the last article to the top level.

- hooked up the ability to save an article into a file or a
  mail message, much like RNEWS.

- hooked up the stuff to allow mailing a message, following up
  to usenet, or posting a new message.

- changed jnews-goto-unread to pop right into the article which
  saves typing and time.

To install and run jnews:

- compile jnews.c and put "jnews" in a directory on your path. 
  "cc -o jnews jnews.c"

- byte compile jnews.el and put jnews.elc in your local lisp
  directory

- create ~/jnews, cd to it, and execute newsrc_to_jnews which 
  will create your jnews summary files

- add the following 2 lines to your .emacs file (and bind keys to 
  the commands if you so choose.)

(autoload 'jnews "jnews" "Read usenet news" t)
(autoload 'jnews-add-newsgroup "jnews" "Add new usenet newsgroup" t)
