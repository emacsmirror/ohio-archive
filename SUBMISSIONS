How To Submit Emacs Lisp Code to the Archive

Time-stamp: <2000-09-24 01:54:30 walters>

1) Make sure that your code has a clear copyright statement near the
   top, with a free software license attached.

   We cannot accept code that does not have a copyright.  In addition,
   please use a license that makes your code free software.  For an
   example of acceptable terms, type 'C-h C-c' inside Emacs.  If in
   doubt, send mail to archive@cis.ohio-state.edu.

2) Please read the section "Tips And Conventions" in the
   Emacs Lisp manual, and try to make your entry conform as much as
   possible to these standards.  It is not strictly required for
   submission, however.

3) Create an Emacs Lisp Archive Entry for your code.

   A) If you are submitting a single .el file, then an ELAE like:

   ;; Emacs Lisp Archive Entry
   ;; Filename: somefile.el
   ;; Author: Jane Schmoe <jane@example.com>
   ;; Version: 1.0

   will suffice.  Just put it somewhere in your file.

   B) If you are creating a multi-file entry (for example, if you
   include Texinfo documentation, or you have multiple .el files),
   then you should create an ELAE like:

   ;; Emacs Lisp Archive Entry   
   ;; Package: foo
   ;; Author: Jane Schmoe <jane@example.com>
   ;; Version: 1.0

   and place the ELAE in the most important .el file in your
   distribution.

   After you have added the ELAE, use the `tar' utility to package
   your files.  The filename should be
   `<package name>-<version>.tar[.gz]'.  Additionally, this archive
   should unpack into a directory with the same name as the tar
   archive, without the 'tar[.gz]' extension.

   For example, the above author could submit her package `foo' as
   `foo-1.0.tar.gz', which should unpack into a directory named
   `foo-1.0'.

   Alternatively, you may use the `zip' utility to compress your
   files.  The rule about unpacking into a directory of the same
   subname (i.e. `foo-1.0.zip' should unpack into a directory
   `foo-1.0') still applies.
				    
4) Send a mail to archive@cis.ohio-state.edu containing your ELAE,
   with the program attached.  

We look forward to having your Emacs Lisp in the archive!
