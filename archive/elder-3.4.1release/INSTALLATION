As of now,  you don't have to do anything to isntall elder.  Just drop
the elder-files somwwhere in your load-path..


OLD:
====================================================

Now we have a userguide and that should supercede this file..
OBTAINING:
This directory contains all of ELDER. You can either download the
files you need, or download the gzipped version which is also
available right here. 

====================================================


[A] To run ELDER through EMACS: load elder.el, say via:
   (load "elder.el")

   Now, (elder filename) opens a filename (ending in .e, if filename
   doesnot end in .e, it looks for <filename>.e), runs elder on it and
   writes the output in a filename with the trailign .e stripped.
   This (elder) can thus work on any document.

   A Latex specialization:
   (etex <filename>) opens file <filename> if <filename> ends in .tex.e,
   else it opens <filename>.tex.e, runs elder on it, and writes the
   resulting <file.tex>.

   similarly, there's a matlab specialization (emat)


[B] Here's a way of running it from command-line. 
    save elder.el, in, say, ~/Emacs/ELDER. 
    [assumes you are running .tcsh...]
    Now, add the foll. to your ~/.aliases file:

alias etex 'echo Don''t worry about the first error;\\
 /bin/rm elder-invoke.el;\\
 echo \(load \"\~/Emacs/ELDER/elder.el\"\) >elder-invoke.el;\\
 echo \(etex \"\!:1\"\) >>elder-invoke.el;\\
 emacs -batch -l elder-invoke.el;\\
 /bin/mv elder-invoke.el elder-invoke.el~'

and make sure your .aliases is sourced, via say, a line
source .aliases
in your .login

Henceforth (etex sample) or (etex sample.tex.e)
will run ELDER on sample.tex.e and write the output in sample.tex.
[[you can similarly define stuff for matlab or a general file.]]
The above works for my tcsh shell; if it does not work on yr machine,
write me, that will make me get around to creating a more stable
invocation scheme..---- deego@glue.umd.edu

By the way, i find these further aliases useful:


alias elat 'etex \!:1; lat \!:1'
alias lata 'tap tetex;  latex \!:1; latex \!:1; dvips \!:1'
alias lat 'tap tetex;  latex \!:1; latex \!:1; dvips \!:1; rmbad'
alias lath 'lat \!:1; latex2html \!:1'
alias latv 'lat \!:1; (gv \!:1  &)'

(and one more: for elatv)

elat <file> etexes a file.tex.e, and then lat's the file.tex   
lat <file>  latexes a file.tex, and dvips's it..

====================================================

If you notice you use the same commands too often, you can group them
into style files. ELDER accepts style files with extension ".est"..
Thus ([ebeg] (estyle "article") [eend])  will insert at (point), the
contents of the file article.est. This file should be placed either in
your current directory, or it should be within ELDERPATH. So, you are
advised to define an $ELDERPATH.. (est ==> Elder STyle)


I have placed a style file article.est in this directory, 
See the help file article.help
