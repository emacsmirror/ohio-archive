	*v 3.0.2
	elder's errors are very detailed..
	moreover, 	elder is now completely interactive. so u can run
	elder-substitute interactively (C-x SPC SPC e s)

	

NOTE THAT ELDER USUALLY PROVIDES very detailed error messages, it not
only tells you what was wrong, it tells you where u were in the file
when  u did go wrong. 

Very Once in a while, it does not. that is due to a bug.. So here's
some usual errors i encountered:

[1] Completely untraceable error:
    Are you doing somehting like:
     (setq aa-version 1.3.1)	?
     
     Note that 1.3.1 is not a number.. I know elder is supposed to
     tell you what the error is, but doesn't seem to work with this
     one. 


[2] ELDER hangs:

    Do you have aliases for "" ? Note that these can produced by:
    (protect "")	too!

    
    Do you have loops within aliases? eg: aa--> bb, and bb--> aa

    eg 2: aa --> aaa
