[1] Any error-messages are VERY detailed, and informative. However,
once in a while, the error-message is very uninformative: 
"Not enough arguments for the format string." Elder is apparently
tryuing to generate an error-message but the code is kaputt somewhere.

But is not a critical bug for now. 

The user always has the option of examining the log file to find out
where he went wrong..
