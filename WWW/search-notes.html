<H3>Notes about the current search engine:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>If you're not getting any results, please keep in mind that the
"main" archive is the (currently rather small) set of Emacs Lisp
programs which have been formally submitted to the archive.  The
"incoming" archive, which is a lot larger, is code that has been
collected from various places on the web, and is in most cases out of
date.  If you're looking for a specific piece of code, your best bet
is to search both archives.</LI>
<LI>The search algorithm weights words by their frequency, position in
the file, and how large the file itself is.</LI>
<LI>No word stemming is performed; For example, to find information
about buffers, you'll probably want to search for both "buffer" and
"buffers".</LI>
</UL>
<H3>About the search engine:</H3>

<P>The search engine is running on an independent machine at my
apartment, because the CIS department is a bit edgy about allowing
dynamic content on their servers.  This might change in the
future.</P>

<P>The server machine is a 120MHz Pentium with 64MB of RAM running <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org"> Debian GNU/Linux</A> (potato).  The
search engine is written in <A HREF="http://www.lisp.org">Common
Lisp</A>, using the excellent <A
HREF="http://cmucl.cons.org">CMUCL</A> implementation, and the <A
HREF="http://araneida.telent.net">Araneida</A> web server.</P>
