<BR>The most recent news is that this archive will probably merge with <a href="http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/~stephen/emacs/ell.html">Emacs Lisp List</a> into <a href="http://www.lispmeralda.org">Lispmeralada</a>.  We hope to have something working soon.  Thanks for your patience!
</P>
<P><FONT size = "5" color = "#000000">Intent to close</FONT> -
<FONT size = "4" color = "#006400">2001/05/02</FONT>
<BR>Well, due to time constraints on my part, I currently plan to
close the OSU Emacs Lisp archive as soon as <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org">Savannah</a> allows for non-GNU
programs.  Savannah is a much more advanced technology; it will allow
for CVS access, etc.  But the archive will remain open until that
time, and probably some time after.  Feel free to mail your comments
about this to <a href="mailto:walters@cis.ohio-state.edu">walters@cis.ohio-state.edu</a>.

<P><FONT size = "5" color = "#000000">Using the search engine</FONT> -
<FONT size = "4" color = "#006400">2001/01/21</FONT>
<BR>When using the search engine, please keep in mind that it by
default only searches the main archive, which is just entries which
have been submitted.  The "incoming" archive is a lot of Emacs Lisp
code that has been collected from various places on the web; it is out
of date, and not necessarily organized.</P>
<P><FONT size = "5" color = "#000000">Search engine</FONT>
 - <FONT size = "4" color = "#006400">2001/01/20</FONT>
<BR>The search engine is starting to shape up.  Further improvements are planned.  If you have any suggestions, please feel free to send them to <a href="mailto:archive@cis.ohio-state.edu">archive@cis.ohio-state.edu</a>.</P>
<P><FONT size = "5" color = "#000000">.zip submissions</FONT>
 - <FONT size = "4" color = "#006400">2000/07/30</FONT>
<BR>Multi-file submissions in the form of `.zip' files are now accepted, in addition to `.tar.gz' files.</P>
<P><FONT size = "5" color = "#000000">We are reopening!</FONT>
 - <FONT size = "4" color = "#006400">2000/07/10</FONT>
<BR>The OSU Elisp archive is now being actively maintained again!
For information on submitting your code to the repository, please see the section

<H4>How To Submit Emacs Lisp Code to the Archive</H4>
<OL><LI><P>Make sure that your code has a clear copyright statement near the
   top, with a free software license attached.</P>
<P>We cannot accept code that does not have a copyright.  In addition,
   please use a license that makes your code free software.  For an
   example of acceptable terms, type 'C-h C-c' inside Emacs.  If in
   doubt, send mail to archive@cis.ohio-state.edu.</P>
</LI>
<LI><P>Please read the section "Tips And Conventions" in the
Emacs Lisp manual, and try to make your entry conform as much as
possible to these standards.  It is not strictly required for
submission, however.</P>
</LI>
<LI>Create an <A href = "/archive/ARCHIVE-ENTRY">Emacs Lisp Archive Entry</A>
 for your code.  For details about the various fields, see <A href = "/archive/ARCHIVE-ENTRY">here</A>
.<UL><LI>If you are submitting a single .el file, then an ELAE like:<PRE>;; Emacs Lisp Archive Entry
;; Filename: somefile.el
;; Author: Jane Schmoe &lt;jane@example.com&gt;
;; Version: 1.0</PRE>
will suffice.  Just put it somewhere in your file.</LI>
<LI>If you are creating a multi-file entry (for example, if you
   include Texinfo documentation, or you have multiple .el files),
   then you should create an ELAE like:<PRE>;; Emacs Lisp Archive Entry
;; Package: foo
;; Author: Jane Schmoe &lt;jane@example.com&gt;
;; Version: 1.0</PRE>
and place the ELAE in the most important .el file in your
   distribution.<P>After you have added the ELAE, use the `tar' utility to package your
files.  The filename should be `&lt;package name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;.tar[.gz]'.
Additionally, this archive should unpack into a directory with the
same name as the tar archive, but without the 'tar[.gz]' extension
(i.e. &lt;package name&gt;-&lt;version&gt;).</P>
<P>For example, the above author could submit her package `foo' as
   `foo-1.0.tar.gz', which should unpack into a directory named
   `foo-1.0'.</P>
<P>Alternatively, you may use the `zip'
utility to compress your files.  The rule about unpacking into a
directory of the same subname (i.e. `foo-1.0.zip' should unpack into a
directory `foo-1.0') still applies.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Send a mail to <a href=mailto:archive@cis.ohio-state.edu>archive@cis.ohio-state.edu</a>
containing your ELAE, with the program attached.</LI>
</OL>
<h3>Updating your entry</h3>
<ul>To update your submission, just send mail to <a href=mailto:archive@cis.ohio-state.edu>archive@cis.ohio-state.edu</a>
with the updated version and a note that this is a submission update.<br>
Please try to keep submissions to around once every few days at most,
unless the update fixes major bugs.
