TEX NAME COMPLETION:

    This package adds Emacs minibuffer name completion to cmutex.el
    or the standard tex-mode.el.

    As a complement to the hairy key bindings for hairy LaTeX commands
    in cmutex.el, here is a package that does not require you to learn
    the key strokes for each command, but lets you enter the name of
    the [La]TeX macro/environment with completion, avoiding dumb typos
    that cost you a wasted TeX run.  This is very handy if you don't
    remember the exact form of a command, font name, name for a
    special symbol, and you don't have the manual or list of symbols
    with you.

    A disadvantage is that is does not know anything about each
    individual command (e.g., number of arguments).  But for these, we
    have the specialized key bindings like 'C-c T' in cmutex.el.  They
    are fine - if you can remember them... 


CONTENTS: 

    There are 4 files:

	README			- this file

	tex-complete.el		- completion functions

	latex-names.el		- list of LaTeX macro names

	tex-names.el		- list of plain TeX macro names


INSTALLATION: 

    Put all lisp files in a directory where Emacs can find them.  The
    *-names files are loaded on the first use of the completion
    commands.

    IF YOU USE THE STANDARD TEX MODE:

    Put the following lines into your ~/.emacs (note TeX-mode vs.
    comint's tex-mode and the single key map for both modes): 

	(setq TeX-mode-hook 
	      '(lambda ()
		 (define-key TeX-mode-map
		   "\C-c\\" 'tex-insert-plain-command)))

	(setq LaTeX-mode-hook
	      '(lambda ()
		 (define-key TeX-mode-map
		   "\C-c\C-m" 'latex-make-environment)
		 (define-key TeX-mode-map
		   "\C-ci" 'latex-insert-begin)
		 (define-key TeX-mode-map
		   "\C-c\\" 'tex-insert-latex-command)))

	(load "tex-complete")

    IF YOU USE CMUTEX:

    Either arrange to load tex-complete *after* cmutex or put
    cmutex-complete into cmutex.el, replacing the definitions of
    latex-make-environment and latex-insert-begin.  Olin Shivers plans
    to add a load hook to cmutex version 2.01, which makes this easy.

    If your version does not have this load hook already, simply add
    the line

	(run-hooks 'cmutex-load-hook)

    at the very end of cmutex.el

    Then you can put the following in your ~/.emacs:

	(setq cmutex-load-hook '(lambda () (load "tex-complete")))

	;; Bind the completion functions to appropriate keys 
	;; '\' may be even better than 'C-c \'

	(setq tex-mode-hook
	      '(lambda ()
		 (define-key tex-mode-map "\C-c\\"
		   'tex-insert-plain-command)))

	(setq latex-mode-hook
	      '(lambda ()
		 (define-key latex-mode-map "\C-c\\"
		   'tex-insert-latex-command)))



EXAMPLE

    Usage of name completion in an Emacs TeX/LaTeX buffer: 

    TeX:	Type 'C-\' and 'c e TAB RET' to insert '\centerline'
		Type 'C-\' and 'h e TAB RET' to insert '\heartsuit'

    LaTeX:	Type 'C-\' and 'c e TAB RET' to insert '\centering'

		Type 'C-c C-m' and 'a b TAB RET' to make an
		`abstract' environment

		Type 'C-c i' and 'a b TAB RET' to insert the beginning
		of an `abstract' environment


REMARKS:

    The macro names have been taken from the TeX sources of plain TeX
    and LaTeX.  Macros defined in additional style files may be
    missing.  In fact, I only added some letter commands.  If you
    enlarge the list, please send me your version or the diffs.

    Even more useful would be a parser for .sty files to extract macro
    and environment names intended to be visible outside.  This seems
    impossible to me unless a standard syntax for declaring public
    macros is used, e.g.

       %%!publiccommand{foo} % goes into list latex-<style>-commands
       %%!publicenvironment{bar} % goes into list latex-<style>-environments

    Each .sty file would have an associated Emacs lisp variable
    containing the public names, and by parsing the \documenstyle
    options just these names would be loaded.  Comments about such a
    declaration syntax (which could be useful for other [documentation]
    purposes as well) are welcome.
