New games included in this file are:

    battleship, reversi, ataxx, chinese checkers, dots, gofish,
    and order and chaos.

    The file "cards.el" is used by gofish, and other games in production.

To install these games, simply put all the files on everyone's
load-path, then copy the following into your .emacs, or modify the
variable listed in talk-spec.el to contain these new games.  Don't
forget to re-bytecompile talk-spec in this case.

(setq talk-legal-multiuser-functions 
      '(("Talk Tac Toe"  talk-tac-toe) ("Hangman" hangman) 
	("Drop 4" drop4) ("Word Thing" word-thing) ("Go Fish" gofish)
	("4 by 4" 4-by-4) ("Dots" dots) ("Battle ship" battleship)
	("Checkers" checkers) ("Reversi" reversi) ("Ataxx" ataxx)
	("Chinese Checkers" china-check) ("Order and Chaos" order-chaos))
      )

Installing the ai game included hering require modifiying a variable like so:

(setq tyrant-ai-games
  '( ("Drop 4" drop4 drop4-ai) ("Gofish" gofish gofish-ai) ) )

Or change tyrn-ai to include the extra game.  Don't forget to
re-bytecompile everything in this case!

!Remember!  Always place the games in everyones load-path and make
them readable, otherwise they are all useless.

Documentation for most of these games are available in the etalk
documentation that comes with the emacs talk distribution.
