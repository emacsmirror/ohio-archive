Extracting emacs lisp function and variable documentation.

There are two files included here gendoc.el, the lisp to extract the
documentation strings and Makeindex a shell script which uses perl 1.0
(patch level 29) to sort the index.

To extract the basic emacs lisp documentation run emacs in batch mode
thus:

42% emacs -batch -l gendoc.el -f make-documentation -kill

(this will take about 15 minutes)

If you run make-documentation interactively you may get extra
functions loaded by your .emacs or by any commands you have run before
make-documentation, which you may want. The above command will give
the documentation for the basic set of lisp functions in your emacs.
This will produce two files 'doc-info.tex' and 'doc-info.sty'.
'doc-info.tex' is about 340K with emacs 17.49.

Next, latex the file 'doc-info.tex' _TWICE_ so that the size of the
table of contents is taken into account in the index and in the table
of contents. (I suppose I could number the table of contents i, ii,
etc.) The latex will produce LOTS of underfull hbox messages, nothing
to worry about! Then run makeindex to produce doc-info.ind from
doc-info.idx and run latex on doc-info.tex one more time!

You will now have a dvi file suitable for printing on A4 paper (about
40 sheets double sided). You will have to adjust the lisp that
generates doc-info.sty for other paper sizes.
